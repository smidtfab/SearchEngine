<a href="/en/Computer_science">computer science</a> for addressing
the problem of creating difficult <a href=
"/en/Metadata">metadata</a>. The idea behind the game is to use the
<a href="/en/Human_computation">computational power of humans</a>
to perform a task that <a href="/en/Computer">computers</a> cannot
yet do (originally, <a href="/en/Image_recognition">image
recognition</a>) by packaging the task as a <a href=
"/en/Video_game">game</a>. It was originally conceived by <a href=
"/en/Luis_von_Ahn">Luis von Ahn</a> of <a href=
"/en/Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
<a href="/en/Google">Google</a> bought a licence to create its own
version of the game in 2006 in order to return better search
results for its online images. <sup><small>[1]</small></sup> The
licence of the data acquired by Ahn&#39;s ESP Game, or the Google
version, is not clear.</p>

<h3 class="head1" id="1.">1. Idea</h3>
<p class="root"><a href="/en/Image_recognition">Image
recognition</a> is currently (as of <a href="/en/2009">2009</a>) a
task that computers are almost incapable of. Humans are perfectly
capable of it, but not necessarily willing.</p>
<p class="root">The applications and uses of having so many labeled
images are significant; for example, more accurate image searching
and accessibility for visually-impaired users (by reading out an
image&#39;s labels).</p>
<p class="root">The idea of partnering two people to label images
ensures that entered words will be accurate. Since the only thing
the two partners have in common is that they both see the same
image, they must enter reasonable labels to have any chance of
agreeing on one.</p>
<p class="root">The ESP Game as it is currently implemented
encourages players to assign “obvious” labels, which are most
likely to lead to an agreement with the partner. But these labels
can often be deduced from the labels already present using an
appropriate language model and such labels therefore add only
little information to the system. <a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70638"
class="external text">A Microsoft research project</a> assigns
probabilities to the next label to be added. This model is then
used in a program, which plays the ESP game without looking at the
image.</p>
