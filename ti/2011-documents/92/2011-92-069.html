<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sim</div><div class="date">12-26-2009, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see many have download this plug-in and I am glad but when one of you have time can you give a little comment on what you think about it and if you have<br />
had any bugs with it, I am sure many of you didn't test it cos they would of had to sign up for a new public and private keys but each key is set for the user this is why we didn't provide you our keys.<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoyed your Xmas and I hope the new year offers you many new<br />
happy times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mystica</div><div class="date">01-05-2010, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, many thanks for this. <br />
<br />
I don't quite understand the processes behind how this works yet, so forgive me if the following question sounds ignorant ... but I was just wondering if there is potential here with this technology, to adapt its use for the creation of an OCR-style screen-capture plugin. I'm referring here, to those screen-capture programs that are capable of not only capturing screeen-images but are also capable of reading the text within the captured image. It would super-magnifico to have an AMS plugin that could do a screen-capture of a window, and then read the text within, to a string-variable. <br />
<br />
Or am I asking for the impossible?<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
I realize it's already possible to grab the text of a window, with AMSWaves AutoIt plugin ... but it would be nice to have a plugin that could do it in a less round-about way, and which was specifically designed for this purpose.</div></div><hr />

This is just reCaptcha  you know the image that hows on comments so bots can't send messages via your website same idea but its built in to ams.<br />
<br />
I not seen the software you are talking about but if you have any links we can surely look in to this.<br />
<br />
Our list of projects do grow by day.<br />

There's a program called &quot;TextCatch&quot; (http://www.skesoft.com) that uses this same OCR technology to actually read the text from within an ordinary screen-capture, and then copies this text to the Windows clipboard. I was just asking it was possible to adapt the technology from your plugin, to build a plugin that would mimic the functions of TextCatch?</div></div><hr />

Tell you the truth I am not sure how they do it we only enable this system to work with ams its all done or reCaps server, I sure will look in to this other one and the OCR tech little later tonight if I have time :)<br />
