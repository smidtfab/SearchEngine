<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&amp;quot">Human Computation</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&amp;quot"><span> </span>In his video presentation <span style="text-decoration: underline">Human Computation</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143#</span>), Luis Von Ahn first addresses the technological growth in our society and the advancement of computer intelligence.<span> </span>Although most technology critics today consider that technology may become more powerful than humans in the future, or that we as humans may become dependent on machinery, Von Ahn argues that this theory is not yet true.<span> </span>Using the example of a CAPTCHA, or the small box of mutated letters that we are prompted to identify when filling out an online form, Von Ahn makes it clear that there are many ways in which humans are capable of processing data in which computers still are not.<span> </span>However, this processing advantage has not been put to good use until now.<span> </span>Hence, Luis Von Ahn created “games with a purpose”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&amp;quot"><span> </span>To support this idea of wasted brain power, Von Ahn gives his audience the example of human hours playing Solitaire.<span> </span>The majority of us have all taken part in this mindless activity, but what most of us do not know is that as a nation, we played for nine billion hours in 2003 (which we can assume was primarily out of boredom and hopefully lack of something else to do).<span> </span>Instead of channeling this brain power towards something unproductive, Von Ahn’s idea was to direct this energy into solving a problem.<span> </span>In this case, identifying images visually, something humans are only capable of.<span> </span>This was done using two independent sources, or the two anonymous players of The ESP Game.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&amp;quot"><span> </span>The ESP Game worked as an effective research project in studying human behavior and also in achieving a task.<span> </span>Von Ahn states that the problem is the turn-up of inaccurate image searches via Google.<span> </span>The computer can only recognize these images based on their label, but if they are incorrectly labeled, a computer has no way of recognizing actual images in the photo and cannot correct this problem.<span> </span>In order to label these images effectively, Von Ahn would need real human brain power.<span> </span>However, in order to do this, fast and cheap, he would have to avoid employing people to sit around and label images all day, and instead, find a way to make people <em>want </em>to label images for him.<span> </span>The ESP Game worked as an effective solution to Von Ahn’s problem.<span> </span>According to the games statistical results, people wanted to play and were playing a lot.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&amp;quot"><span> </span>As far as human behavioral research goes, Von Ahn discovered from The ESP Game that people were becoming “addicted” predominantly because of the connection they felt with their partners.<span> </span>There were also other experimental features added to the game such as an alert that would appear in the bottom right corner of the screen to alert players that their partners had entered a guess.<span> </span>This resulted in four percent longer play for those players who received this alert.<span> </span>Von Ahn also found in his research that although players were attracted to the idea of anonymity of their partner, they typically wondered who their partner was and preferred playing with the opposite sex.<span> </span>From various e-mails and blogs, it was also found that players were driven by the points they received and enjoyed having a sense of achievement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&amp;quot"><span> </span>Von Ahn’s research project has proven to be a very successful one.<span> </span>The game’s popularity has continued to grow, and beyond The ESP Game, new and effective “games with a purpose” have been created.<span> </span>The study of how humans naturally behave can truly be used to effectively to solve problems.<span> </span>Although the key to certain issues may not <em>always</em> be a fun and engaging computer game (unfortunately), the underlying ideas of Von Ahn’s thesis have been proven by his research project.<span> </span>His gaming website, <a href="http://www.gwap.com/">www.gwap.com</a> is evidence of just how far his ideas have come and how many people are avid participants of his research.<span> </span>Who knows what other problems we can conquer from the comfort of our computer chairs?</span></p>
