<p>We are defining what Agile/Lean Localization actually means to digital product companies, please let us know what it means to you? Do you think it works or maybe that it really cannot work at all? Do you even understand what it means? Please share your experiences, feelings and ideas. Challenge or praise it. Especially if you are seeing red and your head bursts, share your feelings with us. It doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, e-mail them to petteri@synble.com or just drop a comment here. We will discuss about these topics and publish best of them here and in our upcoming e-book about Lean Localization!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

	<p><a href="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/conan_year2000.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-502" style="border:none;" title="conan_year2000" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/conan_year2000.jpg?w=150&#038;h=111" alt="" width="150" height="111" /></a>I&#8217;ve been following this debate about translation memories. Are they dead or not? To me it sounded quite confusing until I understood what people actually meant when they talked about &#8220;Translation memory&#8221;. If you have followed this blog, you know that our background is in software development. We create a product for software developers to use, &#8220;f<em>rom developers to developers</em>&#8221; as we say.</p>
<p>So there are now <a href="http://slidesha.re/fDthpV">respected industry veterans telling</a> to the world that &#8220;translation memory should be like a version control system for developers!&#8221;. I have to say that I love this statement and I agree with it fully. Actually I wrote <a href="http://blog.getlocalization.com/2010/02/16/crowdsourcing-localization/">about that</a> over a year ago in this very same blog in almost exactly same wording.</p>
<p>But I would like to propose one thing: <strong>Please stop calling it &#8220;Translation memory&#8221;</strong>. Translation memory is just a feature. It&#8217;s a nice feature in the editor along with other nice features but it just doesn&#8217;t describe the behaviour of current socially enabled localisation platforms like <a href="http://www.getlocalization.com">GetLocalization.com</a> that actually already contains a version management system. It&#8217;s not even the core thing anymore! Call it anything else, I don&#8217;t care but just do not call it &#8220;Translation memory&#8221;.</p>
<p>So in that sense, yes TM alone is definitely dead but technically TM is still a great feature, a little helper that makes translators day a bit easier.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering!</p>

	<p class="comments"><a href="http://blog.getlocalization.com/2011/02/08/get-localization-is-out-of-beta-covering-new-features/#comments">leave a comment &raquo;</a></p>

<div class="main">
	<p><a href="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/blog-post.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-484" style="margin:5px;" title="blog-post" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/blog-post.png?w=150&#038;h=125" alt="" width="150" height="125" /></a>First official release of Get Localization is out and now it would be a good time to go through all the new features we&#8217;ve cooked up for you.</p>
<p>First to make clear, we haven&#8217;t changed our core functionality. We are still free for crowdsourcing but we&#8217;ve now added additional options to crowdsource in more professional manner. This means that the basic offering what we&#8217;ve <strong>will remain <span style="text-decoration:underline;">free</span></strong> like it has been past year.</p>
<p>But we understand that basic crowdsourcing might not be solution to everyone. It&#8217;s a great option for developers to leverage their existing user base by means of engagement.  For example when somebody translates your app, she or he becomes an ambassador for your app in their own country and that is exactly what you want.</p>
<p>However, communities might not be easy to control. Bigger companies typically have deadlines and project plans. It&#8217;s hard to estimate when crowd will finish your translation completely. Our solution to this is bounties. You can set bounty for the language and we will make sure it will get translated by promised deadline. We give you recommended bounty amount that is based on your project size but you can set it yourself as well. Translators can choose their work so more than you set, more faster you will get them. All translations are provided by professional translators and they&#8217;ve 100% money back guarantee so you can be sure that quality meets your needs. You can also combine bounties with basic crowdsourcing by e.g. translating larger updates with volunteers and use bounties to validate and finish the translations. Bounties are now released and ready to be used.</p>
<p>Second important feature is private projects. We understand that there might be some needs to make translation privately. You can freely grant access for your volunteer or professional translators to your project with our easy-to-use user manager.</p>
<p>Third feature is called Pro Moderation. User quality control in Get Localization works through voting and commenting. This way you can rely on your whole user base in quality issues. In addition to that, you can optionally have our trained staff moderate your public project and select the best crowdsourced translations for your product. Basic fee includes moderation for English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Swedish and Finnish. Moderator is suitable for larger companies to support for example their own community manager.</p>
<p>These features are part of Get Localization Plus Package (29,90€/month). Pro Moderation has an additional fee of 179€/month. All prices are VAT excluded. You can upgrade your existing project to Plus plan from the project settings. New users have an option to select wanted features when they register their project.</p>
<p>As always, we are happy to hear your feedback. Let us know what you think!</p>

<div class="main">
	<p><img class="alignleft" style="border:none;margin:5px;" src="http://cache-us.getlocalization.com/logo/gl-logo-224x60.png" alt="" width="224" height="60" />Helsinki, Finland &#8211; Feb 7, 2011 &#8211; Synble Ltd., creator of innovative localization solutions and mobile software, has today released its new generation community service for developers and translators, Get Localization (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgetlocalization.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFP9CwaWSZLyk3N4KX5-ECpmgiVJA">http://getlocalization.com/</a>). This revolutionary service makes localization easier than ever before for software and web development companies.</p>
<p>The market and demand for localized software is growing rapidly. Apple App Store is available in 90 countries and Android Market in almost 50. However, applications are mostly created in English only, regardless of the country where they are developed, leaving large market areas not fully catered for. Numerous web sites can still only be found in a very limited selection of languages.</p>
<p>Get Localization changes the localization process by offering an easy and intuitive cloud service for developers who can now start their localization project in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The service gives developers the opportunity to choose the way of localization that is best suited for their needs. In addition to the traditional approach with localization through professional translators, the developer can choose to engage the user community and crowdsource the translation, or go with a combination of these two. A broad service offering allows to meet the needs of large enterprises as well as self-employed developers.</p>
<p>Get Localization has ideal tools for crowdsourcing localization to the user community. By translating, voting and commenting, the community can easily help their favorite applications gain new grounds. The user interface for translators is very intuitive and extremely easy to learn but still offers powerful productivity aids. This makes it very easy for a new user to get started and helps the user community in creating excellent translations.</p>
<p>One of the numerous projects to have benefited from Get Localization already in beta stage is the all-in-one sports and exercise assistant runtastic for iPhone, Android and Blackberry. After carefully examining available services and the app user community, runtastic decided to engage its users with Get Localization.</p>
<p>According to Stefan Hamm, Head of Mobile Development at runtastic, “localization into Spanish, French and Italian helped us increase downloads with over 100 % and runtastic went straight to top three in health and fitness categories of the respective countries.” Further he adds, “The Get Localization service is very easy to use and it allowed us from the start to focus on localization instead of administration.”</p>
<p>Get Localization fast facts:</p>
<p>- Intuitive web interface for both developers and translators, project can be started within only a few minutes<br />
- Easy uploading for developers, no need for any file conversions for iPhone, Android, Ruby on Rails and numerous other formats.<br />
- Crowdsourcing made easy, as the intuitive translation interface will allow translators to start translating within minutes. Professional translators will recognise core functions of CAT-tools now transformed into a cloud based solution.</p>

	<p><a href="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure_block.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-457 alignleft" style="border:none;" title="measure_block" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure_block.jpg?w=180&#038;h=173" alt="" width="180" height="173" /></a>There&#8217;s a great post about how to measure your product/market fit <a href="http://startup-marketing.com/free-customer-development-help-surveyio/">here</a>. It&#8217;s a recommended reading to anyone interested in a serious product development. This post however, is about us implementing that idea.</p>
<p>So we asked from our developers: <em>How disappointed would you be if you could no longer use this service? </em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a scary question to anyone who has put their heart and all the waking hours to create something others would hopefully use and enjoy. But it&#8217;s a good question to ask, otherwise there&#8217;s no way to know am I wasting time here or maybe doing actually something useful?</p>
<p>Well I think we got the answer to that question and as a bonus some really awesome feedback! Thanks to all who answered, we will read all your feedback for sure. Also thanks to <a href="http://www.kissinsights.com">KISSinsights</a> for providing great free widget for the survey.</p>
<p>So to the results: Staggering 68.2% think that they would be very disappointed if they could no longer use GetLocalization.com (!!!!). 22.7% would be somewhat disappointed and only 9,1% not disappointed at all.</p>
<p>Wow! The team has really put an effort on creating the service so it&#8217;s great to see that you guys and gals appreciate it! For us this means that there&#8217;s a lot of work ahead and meeting all the expectations is going to be tough challenge but we are definitely up to it.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget that you can still give us feedback (we reply) so if there&#8217;s anything in your mind, don&#8217;t hesitate to let us know here in the comments or submit via our <a href="http://support.getlocalization.com">help desk</a>.</p>
<p>Big thanks again for everyone who answered to survey</p>

<p>Quality control is an integral part of software localization work. That sounds self-evident, right? Like something that has to be there, because you don’t want to end up on a list like <a title="Localization blunders" href="http://www.utalkmarketing.com/Pages/Article.aspx?ArticleID=18456" target="_blank">this</a>. But the big question is how (and of course, how much).</p>
<p>The common approach to quality control in localization has traditionally been translating-editing-proofreading (in industry jargon simply TEP). This process consists of two or more professionals, one who translates the text and the other who proofreads it. This often contains a lot of sending files back and forth and some discussions, maybe even arguments, about terminology or grammar. As with all human processes, the end results depend on the individuals involved, but basically traditional TEP offers a good chance of getting good quality results.</p>
<p>But does this great process happen in real translation life? Sure, but all too often you might not want to allocate enough budget to have two professionals on board and you skip the proofreading step. Or you think you don’t have enough time and skip the proofreading step. Or you buy the whole process from someone who says “all translations are proofread by a second professional”, but who still skips the proofreading step. So you end up with a translation that your translation subcontractor (who you found on the Internet without being able to check the references) says is OK, but you have no chance of checking if it really is. Unless you want to pay more and send it to a second vendor for review. Which not only costs money, but also takes time. And if you don’t have a nice budget in your hands, you are probably bound to skip localization testing too. Which means the quality of that single professional is what your end-users will see, be it good or bad.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that localization quality has risks attached to it. We haven&#8217;t even discussed style issues yet: good grammar and fabulous Shakespearian wordings might still not cut it, if the software doesn&#8217;t speak the kind of language expected by the buyers.</p>
<p>The end-users are of course the ones who should be happy with the localized texts. What if they would be the one who helped you in quality assurance? Heck, if you have a nice app with loyal users, there’s a fair chance they’d love your software even more having been allowed to participate in the process.</p>

We&#8217;ve achieved so much in this 10 months that it&#8217;s unbelievable. I&#8217;ll present some numbers and also will shred some light what are our goals for 2011.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve followed our story here in Blog, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/getlocalization">Twitter </a>or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Get-Localization/111800452182373">Facebook</a> you&#8217;ve seen that our socially enabled web-based CAT-tool has matured and grown really fast. There has been tremendous interest in things what we do, both from developers and translation community. And what has brought a great satisfaction to me has been the success of crowdsourcing. We&#8217;ve proofed that it really works and it has been working much better than we ever expected. We&#8217;ve activated thousands of hobbyists, software users and professional translators to work on projects that developers started. Amount of words translated is increasing 100% every month and we see more and more active (and also inactive) projects. Currently about 25% of registered projects are active (has one or more translator), however it is increasing and this is one of the key meters we will follow closely while  improving this year.</p>
<p>Android and iPhone seem to be ruling the platform wars on mobile side.  Regarding web platforms, no surprises there either. The usual suspects Ruby on Rails, PHP based CMS&#8217;s and Django are currently mostly used web platforms in GetLocalization.com projects.</p>
<p>So this year has been more about development. Next year will be about growth. We got good start and we are already growing organically so we just need to increase the pace and let people know we are here! You can also help, in every <a href="http://www.getlocalization.com">GetLocalization.com</a> project there&#8217;s a like and tweet buttons, click them to promote and support the project and us as well.</p>
<p>So in year 2011 Get Localization is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get Localization is a community for Developers and Translators to work together and create applications everyone can understand.</p></blockquote>
<p>To break this down:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are a community as a whole and we do have smaller communities within our community.</li>
<li>Every project space (private or public) is a place for Developers and Translators to form their own community</li>
<li>We do this so people can have applications they understand, so that overall user experience for applications would be better. This is a win-win for everyone. We as a application makers win when users win.</li>
</ol>
<p>So this is what we are so eagerly taking forward. Please follow our journey and give us your feedback, it will be greatly appreciated. Thanks for the past year and Happy New Year 2011!</p>

	<p class="comments"><a href="http://blog.getlocalization.com/2010/12/09/covering-latest-get-localization-release/#comments">with one comment</a></p>

<div class="main">
	<p><a href="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/construction.jpg"><br />
</a>We&#8217;ve been extremely busy implementing a bunch of new features lately. Or actually they&#8217;ve been out already week or so but now it is good time to cover all of them.</p>
<h2>Project feed</h2>
<p>Project feed is a great new addition to service. Actually we&#8217;ve asked ourselves why it hasn&#8217;t been here before. It is pretty similar to Facebook news feed but project specific. It means everybody can see easily what is happening in the project. Here&#8217;s example what is happening in <a title="AppUpdateNotifier" href="http://www.getlocalization.com/AppUpdateNotifier/">AppUpdateNotifier</a> project:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;border:none;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:none;" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/project_feed.png?w=700" alt="" /></p>
<p>Cool huh? It&#8217;s an awesome addition and will make managing projects and translations much more fun!</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>This is a second feature we thought that we are really late with, but better late than never! It is Statistics and we&#8217;ve even reserved own tab for them. For example we&#8217;ve added list of contributors, you can get them for whole project or just for single language. Here for example we&#8217;ve top translators for German from <a title="GoogaSync" href="http://www.getlocalization.com/GoogaSync" target="_blank">GoogaSync </a>project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-376" style="border:none;" title="contributors" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/contributors.png?w=300&#038;h=343" alt="" width="300" height="343" />We are now in the works for providing new stats and also improving current offering.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Discussion is now back in Editor as well. We had comments in previous editor but now they are back in our new version as well. Here&#8217;s screenshot how it looks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378" style="border:none;" title="comments" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/comments.png?w=632&#038;h=771" alt="" width="632" height="771" /></p>
<h2>And much more&#8230;</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve lots of other smaller improvements in as well. This also means that we are starting to be feature complete in a sense that we can soon finally come out of beta. This will hopefully happen soon. So stay tuned and let us know what you think!</p>

<div class="main">
	<p><a href="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stacks-of-money.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-348" style="border:0 initial initial;" title="stacks-of-money" src="http://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stacks-of-money.jpg?w=134&#038;h=134" alt="" width="134" height="134" /></a>Facebook has Director of Monetization. It&#8217;s funny that company like Facebook really has to have somebody responsible for making money. Being valuation of 30 something billion, some people might think it is CEO&#8217;s job and the whole purpose of the company. Well it doesn&#8217;t always work like that, especially when you want to create something good. You have to have huge vision and you need to devote all your time and energy while working towards it. The bigger the goal is, the more strongly we want to achieve it.</p>
<p>Get Localization&#8217;s goal has and have been to revolutionize whole software localization industry. Our background is in developing software and we do that really well. We are not localization professionals and in fact when people have asked why we started to develop something like this, the answer has been &#8221;Because we hate localization&#8221;. We came to this business because we asked ourselves &#8220;Why this needs to be so difficult?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well I think we are half-way there. We have had success cases, for example our own products have been translated to over 20 languages among many other cases. Just following our own way of doing things, we&#8217;ve managed to build software localization community that is totally unique and stands on its own. But to really revolutionize this industry, there needs to be new business models. Why?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While demand for language services has continued to grow (at a rate of over 13% per year), for the most part the price of translation and localization services has dropped<strong>.</strong><em>&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Media/PressReleases/tabid/98/Default.aspx?udt_1084_param_detail=3350">Common Sense Advisory, August 2010</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds healthy to you? Come on, is it really so that couple of nerds needs to come and tell you that this doesn&#8217;t make sense? Localization industry needs their own Director of Monetization. But uttermost localization industry needs to wake up and start thinking how to improve their <strong>product</strong>. It is not ideal if us, developers, your customers need to enter this business in order to make things happen.</p>
<p>To make money, you need to have that HUGE vision. How long you can make business just by <a href="http://alexeames.com/blog/2010/lionbridge-upsets-translators-with-5-discount-demand/">screwing translators</a>? Are you thinking out of the box? Are you really asking what your customers need? Are you really thinking where and how you can make that money? Do you understand that everything will change?</p>
<p>If not, you are going to die.</p>
