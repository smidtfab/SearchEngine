  <font face="Times New Roman">During the 19<sup>th</sup> century, there were no computers, of course.<br>
But people were creative enough to imagine such things.<br>
<br>
Can a machine be made to talk? Can a machine be made to imitate humans?<br>
Can a machine be made do something as complicated as playing chess??<br>
<br>
These people surely had the imagination, but not the technology. But they
had other attributes besides imagination. Engineering and craftsmanship was in
no way inferior that that of today, and in many respects, it was greater.Clockmakers and
cabinetmakers had reach a high point in the history of their fields. Clever contraptions
and mechanical marvels were in great demand.<br>
<br>
People craved entertainment, but lacked the unending supply we know today.
Is it any wonder that some people found a way to work around the technological
deficiencies and create mystifying mechanical wonders that not only played
chess, but defeated almost all challengers! <br>

      <td valign="Top"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The strange story of Ajeeb</b><br>
Built by Charles Hopper, a Bristol cabinet maker, in 1865. Ajeeb's countenance
was made to match the great departed Turk, whichhad been destroyed in a fire
in Philadelphia eleven years prior to Hooper's start on the project, to bring
to mind its great success in the world of high society. A life-size figure
was operated by many chess and checker players including Constant Ferdinand
Burille. He played 900+ games and lost only three times and never lost a checker
game. Between 1898 and 1904 it was operated by Pillsbury. In the Edem Museum,
New York, it played checkers for a dime and a game of chess for 25 cents.
Opponents of Ajeeb included Roosevelt, Houdini, Admiral Dewey, Henry and
Sarah Bernhardt and O. Henry. It stood 10 feet in height and was first exhibited
at the Royal Polytechnic Institute in Londonin 1868. Between 1868 and 1876
it was on show at the Crystal Palace. 100,000+ people viewed it in Berlin
during a three month period.&nbsp; It played at Breslau, Dresden, Leipzig,
Hanover, Magdeburg, Cologne, Elbefeld, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt and Wiesbaden.
Afterwards it visited Brussels and Paris. Here Zukertort is said to have
played against it. Rosenthal played it twice, winning one and losing one. In
1885 Ajeeb visited New York, Minneapolis, Chicago and Kansas City. Charles
F. Moehle and Charles Francis Barker, U. S. draughts champion, worked the machine
in turn.<br>
 Sometime in the 1880's,&nbsp; Hooper sold Ajeeb to Jim Smith and retired
to England. Smith move his prized automaton to Coney Island. Here the operator
was Sam Gotski. During his time Gotski was required by Smith to take on an
apprentice to learn the ropes of how Ajeeb worked. In one instance, a sore
loser shot Ajeeb in the torso and supposedly wounded its operator. However
Gotski, Smith, and several others knew that the apprentice had been killed.
To cover up for there still successful automaton, they got rid of the apprentice's
body. Due to the hobo/transient nature of the apprentice who was known by
no reputable or believable sources, the murder was never discovered. <br>
By 1898, Sam was no longer the operator. He left complaining of strange occurrences
from inside Ajeeb where the automaton was moving on its own accord. Gotski
and Smith remained mutually silent in regard to their crime despite of their
separation. Sam then moved into the New York City Dinner Club circuit where
he worked behind the scenes for struggling magicians. By 1926, the elderly
Sam became friends with stagehand Gustav Burzendt, a distant relative of Kempelens*
of Vienna, who had developed a curiosity in Mechanomancy due to the Baron.
There friendship was brief. It was cut short when Sam started to suspect that
Gustav knew something of the incident. <br>
Sam disappeared from New York City, never to be seen again. <br>
In that time Ajeeb had gone through two other operators. Both sometime later
reported to friends and family brief incidents where Ajeeb seem to acting
on its own accord. Allegedly, the last operator refused to play anythingbut
checkers due to strange occurrences within the automaton. <br>
Gustav Burzendt now fueled with desires to surpass his great uncle, desired
to gain Ajeeb. When he couldn't afford to buy it from Coney Island, he began
to contemplate its theft. <br>
Another operator was Albert Beauregard Hodges (1861-1944). This former U.S.
Champion's first job was a hidden operator of Ajeeb, the Chess Automation.
He played chess and checkers. He won the US championship in 1894 after defeating
Jackson Showalter. He never defended his title. Pillsbury challenged him in
1895 but Hodges declined for business reasons. He was the only American master
to play against 5 world chess champions over a period of 60 years. He played
Zukertort, Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine. He won the Manhattan
Chess Club Championship and the New York championship. <br>
Pillsbury! One of the greatest natural players ever and the greatest blindfold
player of his day operated Ajeeb&nbsp; between 1898 and 1904. His early death
is said to have be partly attributed to being cooped up in the small operating
area of&nbsp; this machine causing great pain for which he drank heavily to
endure. <br>
      <br>
 On March l5th, 1926, Ajeeb was allegedly destroyed by a fire on Coney Island.
      <br>
      <br>
In 1932, two men, Frank Farina and Jesse Henley bought a copy of Ajeeb from
a mysterious craftsman named Gus Burns and took it on tour of Canada. Henley
was master at checkers and never lost. While on tour they heard rumors that
their Ajeeb somehow possessed occult powers. Farina curious investigated the
source of these rumors and discovered that it was a confusion concerning another
chess playing machine also called Ajeeb which was also touring Canada. This
one was not only a chess player but was an astute observer of human nature.
Some thought it could tell the future. What Farina <br>
discovered no one knows. In the flurry of World War Two, Farina, Henley, and
their Ajeeb disappeared from sight. Stories of Ajeeb sightings have proliferated
through the dwindling numbers of Clockworkers slowly since these adepts are
not very sociable. Naturally many are conflicting but there are several points
of consistency. Ajeeb resides somewhere in Ontario and is more than likely
being served by the descendants of Burzendt. 
 "A golden means between machine and spirit not fully known"
is how most Clockworkers respond to Ajeeb inquiries if at all. If there is
a Clockworker who has sought the council of Ajeeb, none will admit to it.
It represents their greatest fear: a creation that far outstrips its creator.
      <br>
      <br>
Perhaps the most interesting episode involving a U.S. President occurred around
September 1885, when both the U.S. president and vice-president visitedachess
event together! The incident was described as follows in the September1885
issue of The International Chess Magazine: <br>
"Ajeeb, 'The Chess Automaton', is now giving exhibitions at Eden Musee, Twenty-third
Street, New York. We learn from the Evening Telegram that President Cleveland
and Vice-President Hendricks paid a visit recently to Ajeeb's chess room,
and the latter had a game with the figure which 'The Automaton' finished with
a neat five-move version of the so-called Philidor's Legacy or smothered mate."
      <br>
Unfortunately, we do not know who the hidden player inside Ajeeb was on that
occasion, but Albert Hodges, a one-time claimant to the US championship, was
one of its secret operators. Sadly, vice-president Hendricks died in office
only two months after losing that game. President Cleveland went on in 1888
to become the only president to win the popular vote while losing in the electoral
college. He then became the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms
when he avenged his 1888 defeat in the 1892 election.      <b><br>

      <div align="Justify"><font face="Times New Roman">During the late 18th and early 19th Centuries,
a chess-playing &ldquo;machine&rdquo; toured Europe and America, defeating
almost all comers. The Chess Automaton, better known as &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo;,
invented by Baron Wolfgang Von Kempelen. Purporting to be a chess-playing
machine, &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo; was actually an ingenious fraud: it was in
reality a contraption designed to allow a hidden human operator to play a
game without seeing the board or touching the pieces. Baron Von Kempelen hired
a succession of chess masters to sit inside &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo;,and he
made a fortune displaying the device, despite continual threats of blackmail
by persons who had -- or thought they had -- discovered how the &ldquo;machine&rdquo;
operated. Indeed, early in the Automaton&rsquo;s career, one Freiherr VonRacknitz
published an expose accurately describing a.) how the operator remained hidden
while the Baron opened all the cabinets to assure viewers no one was inside,
and b.) how he could see the moves made by his opponents. Von Racknitz went
so far as to construct his own version, but his design proved less ingenious
than Von Kempelen&rsquo;s and attracted little notice. In truth, Von Kempelen
was an excellent technician: for example,he devised machines which reproduced
sounds from nature, including the human voice, which were said to have inspired
Alexander Graham Bell to begin work on the telephone. The Automaton was similarly
intricate: although not capable of chess play, &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo; was nonetheless
an impressive technical achievement for that time and place. <br>
Von Kempelen sold his creation to a musician/inventor/showman named Johann
Maelzel, who revived the Automaton&rsquo;s career. Napoleon was among the
many luminaries who contested a game with the Automaton during Maelzel&rsquo;s
ownership. Maelzel&rsquo;s friend and business partner, Ludwig Van Beethoven,
might at one time have had a financial interest in &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo;.
The time of Beethoven&rsquo;s partnership with the inventor was certainly
among the most profitable of the composer&rsquo;s career, although that probably
had more to do with some of Maelzel&rsquo;s other efforts, like the Panharmonicum
-- a machine that essentially simulated an orchestra by playing multiple instruments
automatically (Beethoven wrote a &ldquo;symphony&rdquo; for thePanharmonicum,
to commemorate Wellington&rsquo;s victory over Napoleon at Waterloo). Butlater,
Maelzel fell into financial difficulties as crowds for the Chess Automaton
dried up; so, like many debtors of that era, he and &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo;
(AND the chessplayer operating &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo;)emigrated to America.
The Automaton was a sensation in the United States, and many articles were
written purporting to explain how it worked. Edgar Allen Poe wrote one; but
even though he appeared to have heard of Von Racknitz&rsquo;s correct explanations
of the Automaton&rsquo;s workings, Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;deductions&rdquo;of
how it must operate were entirely mistaken. The author did score one point,
though: he correctly identified who was playing the game, basically on the
Superman/Clark Kent evidence -- Poe noted that the chessplayer was always
around before and after &ldquo;The Turk&rdquo;&rsquo;s games, but never while
a game was in progress. <br>
&ldquo;The Turk&rsquo;s&quot; career came to an end not long afterward :the
chess player died of a sudden illness, and Maelzel died shortly thereafter.
Stored in a warehouse, the Automaton was destroyed in a fire some years later.
But it&rsquo;s legend did not die quite as easily, and after some 40 years,
a new Automaton -- this one called &ldquo;Ajeeb&rdquo; -- began making the
rounds in the United States and England. &ldquo;Ajeeb&rdquo; played checkers
as well as chess -- players who were masters of both were easy enough to find
in those days, and the quick money to be had tempted some of the best. For
a while, the U. S. Chess Champion, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, worked inside &ldquo;Ajeeb&rdquo;.
The Turk&rsquo;s story was repeated in many particulars, including threats
of exposure and the construction of arrival machine called &ldquo;Mephisto&rdquo;.
But in time, the novelty wore off and &ldquo;Ajeeb&rdquo; went into retirement
-- eventually perishing in a fire like its more famous predecessor. <br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
William Lewis was a famous nineteenth century chess theoretician and author
who can perhaps lay claim to having been the first chess playing robot. <br>
He was in fact the player concealed inside the notorious chess playing automaton
"The Turk" when it was exhibited in London in 1819.<br>
After his chess rooms business went into bankruptcy in 1827 he turned his
hand to writing and became very successful. Among his publications were Chessboard
Companion, published in 1838.<br>
His Series of Progressive Lessons in the Game of Chess is regarded as a landmark
in chess literature. He also wrote The Elements of Chess(1882) Fifty Games
of Chess(1832) and Chess for Beginners (1835).<br>
In addition he translated into English the works of Greco and Stamma. <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1806, Napoleon was the most talked-about man
on Earth. His armies had captured a great deal of Europe, and he was on his way
to becoming the greatest conquering general (or thug, depending on your point
of view) of all time. <br>
The Little Corporal fancied himself a strong chess player. As the story is
told, Napoleon heard of a chess-playing machine called "The Turk" that was
able to beat most, if not all, challengers. Eventually, Napoleon arranged
to meet the Turk in Berlin. <br>
The "machine" was a strange-looking contraption: a large box with a chessboard
on top, and a mannequin dressed up in a gaudy Turkish outfit attached. An
opening on the side of the device revealed a complex interior network of pulleys and gears. <br>
The French Emperor sat down, and intentionally made an illegal move. The mechanical
mannequin shook its head &mdash; an "error message" if you will. Napoleon then
made another illegal move, and The Turk again shook its head. After several
consecutive illegal first moves on by Napoleon, the mechanical chess machine's
mannequin violently swept all the pieces off the board. <br>
Napoleon laughed; he had played "mess up the chess machine," and won. Afterward,
Napoleon did play against the Turk, and lost. (Contrary to what you might
have heard, the guy was a lousy chess player.) <br>
The Turk, as you may have guessed, contained within its mannequin portion
a very talented chess-playing midget &mdash; one of several who would keep
The Turk a very successful side show attraction for many years to come.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp; supposed photograph of
the Turk but most likely a replica<br>
&nbsp; A slightly different version:<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
During the 1820s and 1830s a Chess Automaton toured the United States, where
it became the focus of intense curiosity and speculation. The Automaton was
supposedly a complex machine that was able to play chess against a human opponent.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
The machine was built in the shape of a life-size man who sat in front of a
large cabinet that served as a table. The man was made of wood and dressed
in Turkish clothes. He was usually referred to as "the Turk." Before the automaton
was used, all the doors of the cabinet were opened on opposite sides (one pair
at a time), and a candle's light was shined through the cavity, to demonstrate
to the audience that no one was hidden inside. The first third of the cabinet
was filled with clockwork gears, while the rest was more or less empty. The
(human) opponent played on a separate table with a separate board and pieces.
A large key was used to wind up the automaton's mechanism before each game.
The automaton always played white, thus going first. The operator started the
game by reaching inside the small door in the torso of the automaton and flipping
a switch. The sound of machinery could be heard each time the automaton moved.
Games usually lasted about 30 minutes. <br>
The Automaton had originally been built in Europe in 1769 by an inventor known
as Baron Kempelen, a nobleman of Presburg in Hungary. He had entertained the
court of Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna with it for three years before dismantling
it. The Automaton was taken out of storage in 1783, put back together, and
brought to London by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel. Eventually it made its way to
America. <br>
In 1836 an anonymous article appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger.
The article, through careful analysis, exposed the Automaton to be an outlandish
hoax. The author deduced that there was a man hidden inside the cabinet who
was working the machinery, and the author even identified the man by name:
William Schlumberger, who was a companion of the showman Maelzel. <br>
The anonymous article was written by Edgar Allan Poe. Although he himself
perpetrated many hoaxes (the adventures of Hans Pfaall, the great balloon
hoax, the facts in the case of M. Valdemar, and Van Kempelen and his discovery),
in this case he exposed one. <br>
The Automaton was eventually bought at auction by John F. Ohl of Philadelphia
and came to rest in the Chinese Museum in Philadelphia. It was destroyed by
fire in 1854. <br>

        <img src="Turk1.jpg" alt="the Turk" width="319" height="253"><img src="Turk1b.jpg" alt="the Turk" width="316" height="254"><br>
&nbsp; Yet, another version:<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Johann N. Maelzel was a mechanical engineer who bought the Turk from Wolfgang
von Kempelen's son. He supposedly invented the metronome and was a good friend
of Beethoven. Prince Eugene de Beauharnais bought the Turk from Maelzel in
1811 for 30,000 francs and Maelzel gave part of the money to Beethoven. In
1817 he bought the Turk back from the Prince for the same sum. No cash was
handed over to the Prince, but Maelzel was to pay from any profit he might
make. The Prince died but his heirs sued Maelzel for the balance. Maelzel
fled to America with the Turk to escape the debts and lawsuits. Maelzel was
buried at sea in 1838 after dying on a ship bound from Cuba to America. <br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font> </div>
        <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
The Turk was, of course, an elaborate hoax, and its movements were controlled
by a concealed operator. This was confirmed by Dr Mitchell, its last owner,
who wrote an article about it for the Chess Monthly in 1857. <br>
Ironically, given Von Kempelen's desire to upstage the magnetic tricks of
a conjuror, it relied on magnets in the chess pieces which set tiny, delicate
indicators under each square swinging whenever a piece was picked up or put
down. <br>
The operator, an expert chess-player hidden in a concealed compartment in
the cabinet, followed the action on another chessboard inside the machine,
and carried out the Turk's moves using an ingenious mechanical arm that was
itself a masterpiece of engineering. <br>
