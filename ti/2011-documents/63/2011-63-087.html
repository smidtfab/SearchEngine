    <p>1. In this article, Nathan Eagle looks into a crowdsourcing system, txteagle, that uses mobile phones to perform the crowdsouring, possibly opening supplementary income possibilities to rural and low income populations (in this case, people in Kenya)</p><p>2.  I think this paper makes a pretty convincing argument why such a system as txteagle could work and why this system (and ones like it) could be important.)</p><p>3. I think that this paper is supposed to be a proof of concept sort of this, but I found it strange/distracting that it ends in a somewhat unfinished place and I think this is a weakness of the article because it is not fully fleshed out.</p><p>4. Before reading this article, I had not read anything about txteagle, or other systems using crowdsourcing among low income populations and had not really considered a mobile phone based system such as this.</p><p>5. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I did not understand the equation Eagle used to improve accuracy of his system, and while I do not think this is essential to my understanding of the article, I wish I could understand it better.</p><p>6. I would like to know how this system has developed or if it is still developing and whether Eagle (or someone else) has developed any other similar systems.</p>

    <p>Regarding the math in this paper: I found the explanations behind these formulas to be exceedingly brief.  In trying to understand the notation I looked at the Sheng paper mentioned and discovered that these expressions are lifted straight out of that paper.  I haven't studied it yet but at first glance Sheng et al seem to do a much better job of explaining.  That paper is available here:</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~panos/publications/kdd2008.pdf">pages.stern.nyu.edu/~panos/publications/kdd2008.pdf</a></p><p>Check out section 3.1 "Notation and Assumptions."</p>

    <p>1. This paper presents a system that enables crowdsourcing from a mobile device, which was deployed in Kenya and used by people from different social groups.</p><p>2.

    <p>1. This paper is the report about mobile crowdsourcing service actively being used in east Africa.</p><p>2. This is a successful mobile crowdsourcing business case study. It was really interesting showing how mobile crowdsourcing service works in a real environment with a concrete example explaining about reward, job allocation, job aggregation, quality control.</p><p>3. In the part about quality control using a statistical method, it would be better if that part would have more explanation with the real data.</p><p>4. Crowdsourcing uses the platform where people can be connected through regardless of geographical location. Mobile platform is superior than the web platform in the perspective of mobility and easy-accessibility. I’ve seen unlimited potential of crowdsourcing business on the mobile platform.</p><p>5. In my opinion, one of the most difficult barriers of crowdsourcing is quality control. I am not sure that using simple statistical method can make data collected from crowdsourcing relevant, robust, trustworthy.</p><p>6. When I was at the industry, my former company outsourced routine data work such as search result evaluation, adult image filtering, spam filtering to China. They hired many Chinese people who can read Korean and they had several business trips to China to control their workforces. If the mobile service like txteable would be prosperous in Korea, Korean portal could harness such high quality data service.</p>

    <p>Reading notes: txteagle: Mobile Crowdsourcing</p><p>1. Summary of paper: The paper explains the current situation of mobile phone usage in developing countries, especially in Kanya. And by pointing out how popular mobile phones are, the paper talked about how mobile phones can be used as a platform for people to complete Crowdsourcing tasks.</p><p>2. Greatest strength: The Paper first pointed out the popularity of mobile phones in developing countries, this gives a great background on how Crowdsourcing tasks can be accessed by people in these areas. And by providing Interaction Scenarios, the paper gives readers a clear vision of how Mobile Crowdsourcing works can be done.</p><p>3. Greatest weakness: The paper doesn't talk about the fee of text or calls for mobile phones and the contract between service providers. This might increase the cost of Crowdsourcing task providers. And if the completed task was not accepted, the worker not only get nothing, but also have to pay for texting or calling. This will be a risk for them.</p><p>4. Something I learned: Mobile phones are so popular in even the poorest areas in the world. And people are using them to complete tasks already.</p><p>5. Something I didn't understand: How would the users know when jobs are available? Do they have to ask for a job? Are there always suitable jobs for them to do? If they had to ask for a job, is this a little different with the general Crowdsourcing tasks where companies post jobs first then people can select jobs that are suitable for them.</p><p>6. Something I'd like to know more about: The paper mainly talks about the situation in developing countries, what about in developed countries or richer areas. Are people willing to complete even harder tasks via their mobile devices? What are the advantages and disadvantages comparing to regular web Crowdsourcing tasks.</p>

    <p>[KyongHwa Bae] Txteagle: Mobile Crowdsourcing</p><p>In this article, the author describes the Kenyan mobile service 'txteagle' which is a good example of mobile Crowdsourcing.</p><p>According to the paper over 90% of East Africa’s population lives in an area with GSM reception. In addition, large numbers of mobile phone subscribers live within other developing countries. Therefore, mobile services provide the unique ability to reach large numbers of people in rural and low income areas. The paper provides several cases demonstrating how people in Kenya are using the txteagle system and consequently receive financial benefits through those services. I found it especially interesting to learn how the Crowdsourcing model is being used to reach unemployed people in remote, impoverished areas and positively impact their lives. However, I was disappointed that the author limited the discussion to using people’s labor for doing time-consuming, simple and tedious things. It seems that the possibilities to impact people's lives with this technology could easily extend to providing education, acquiring job skills or aggregating ideas about building infrastructures. It was not clear to me why the author added the system design part which talks about the EM algorithm. It is not coherent with the other parts of the paper.</p>

    <p>1. This article details the creation of txteagle, a mobile crowdsourcing service based in East Africa that pays for services rendered with phone airtime.</p><p>2. I thought the greatest strength of the article was the ingenuity of the author’s idea – they were able to create a service from an amalgamation of several cutting edge technologies.</p><p>3. The greatest weakness of the article stems from a lack of foresight into future problems stemming from a payment system comprised entirely of airtime minutes. In vast numbers, can this be truly sustainable?</p><p>4.

I don’t entirely understand the math used to calculate accuracy and user evaluation – but admittedly, it’s been a couple of years since I’ve taken my last stats class.</p><p>6. I’d like to know more about the user experiences when participating in this crowdsourcing project in Africa – how easily can it be done? How do people find out about it?

    <p>1. Summary: Like industrialisation replaced human labour by machines for economic benefit, today's information age and technological advancement has given rise to numerous tasks that can be accomplised cheaply by human contribution compared to the machines. The question remains how to access this cheap human labour and how to put in place a mechanism that will ensure that work gets done and the workers get paid. As a solution, the paper talks about high mobile penetration in some of the developing countries with unemployment rates  as high as 50%. The high availability of mobile phone has given rise to a business proposition - a chance for companies to get work down cheaply and a chance for the poorly paid (or unemployed) 3rd world citizens to make supplementary income.</p><p>2. The paper's strength lies in giving examples of real life tasks that can be performed on a mobile phone</p><p>3. The solution proposed in the paper is limited to only literate people. A vast majority of cellphone subscribers in the developing world are illiterate.</p><p>4. I learned the concept of currency transfer via phones (MPESA).</p><p>5. I did not understand the calculations used to estimate the user's response accuracy in the paper.</p><p>6. I think MPESA concept could solve the financing problems in rural areas of the developing world. I would therefore like to know more about it.</p><p>Aditya Rawal</p>

    <p>Michael Anderson</p><p>The author's mobile phone-based application of crowdsourcing implements Brenham's call for justice by providing a source of income for workers in developing countries where unemployment approaches 50%. Noting that in East Africa, 90% of the population has access to mobile reception and that the vast majority of mobile phone subscribers, "live in the developing world," Eagle first created a mechanism to gather blood bank levels in Kenyan hospitals via text message in order to more effectively manage blood supplies.</p><p>The experiment initially failed until motivation was provided to nurses in the form of airtime credits, a payment which serves as, "a surrogate for currency." A subsequent implementation using USSD messaging which has no associated airtime charges is pending. While the cost to the crowd will be eliminated in this new iteration, some motivational factor will likely be required to achieve widespread participation.</p><p>In order to deal with the issue of accuracy, Eagle extended the expectation maximization model to estimate and account for reporting bias. The author incorporated task repetition through a majority voting algorithm and found that quality approached the 98% level when the number of users exceeded 13. However, Eagle extended the majority voting approach by incorporating summative measures to infer individual accuracy based on task type which allowed his model to estimate any given user's accuracy and expertise. It is unclear if expertise is assigned greater weight in the data aggregation.</p><p>Eagle surveys several tasks which seem appropriate for a crowdsourcing approach—transcription and localization, journalism, search refinement, sentiment and market research—and describes implementations within specific user scenarios. While the model is still for-profit, the overarching ethical goal provides an effective realization for Brenham's problem-solving approach in non-profit initiatives.</p>

    <p>1. This paper first explains the business idea behind and region of application of txteagle, a Crowdsourcing system that ports the idea to mobile phones, then goes into details about the algorithms used to improve data quality.</p><p>2. It gives a good account of the history of the idea and business behind txteagle, as it explains why the first attempt at such a system failed and then contrasts that with the succesfull second attempt.</p><p>3. The second, more mathy, part appears disjointed from the first business/history part, also the given formulae are copy & pasted from other papers - here higher quality would have been expected, especially since the author is also the creator of txteagle.</p><p>4. I got an idea of how Crowdsourcing can be implemented to serve in less industrialized countries.</p><p>5. While after careful reading, I did comprehend the formulae in concept, their presentation in the paper is sloppy (see 3.) and thus a full understanding could not be achieved.</p><p>6. Apparently txteagle has come a long way since this paper was published, hence I would like to know how the business developed.</p>
