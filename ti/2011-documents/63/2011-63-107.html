		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My crowdsourcing radar used to consist of Google Alerts and
a RSS feed from Technorati. Then I installed TweetDeck on my laptop. I&#39;m not sure if it was the best or the worst thing I&#39;ve
ever done. I had thought of Twitter as a broadcast tool, but it&#39;s become far more valuable to me as a listening device. I used to say that keeping track of crowdsourcing&#39;s growth was a full-time job (the punchline being that I already have a a few full-time jobs).&#0160; Now it would take an entire newsroom (okay, a small one) to cover the diverse, imaginative—and occasionally <a href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b105808_sorry_nasa_colbert_conquers_final.html">wrong-headed</a>—ways crowdsourcing is manifesting in our culture. Anyway, here were a few of the more significant developments from the week:</p><p><strong>Open for Questions, or Open for Vote Rigging? </strong><br />President Obama held the first <a href="http://personaldemocracy.com/node/7333">crowdsourced press conference</a>. The administration used Google Moderator to collect questions from citizens, and vote for those already posed. Results were decidedly mixed. The marijuana lobby turned out in force, effectively stuffing the ballot box for decriminalization topics. My colleage Nick Thompson has done my work for me <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/will-obama-cave.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/liveblogging-th.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/drug-legalizati.html">here</a>. The long and short of it is that one interest group gamed the system to vote their concerns to the top. As scores of other people have pointed out, decriminalization is a legitimate topic for a press conference, but hardly represents a pressing issue. My read: Open for Questions highlights that the ideastorm model of crowdsourcing is still very much in a beta phase, useful for some applications and counter-productive for others. </p><p><strong>An Index of Crowdsourcing</strong><br />Boy has this been a long time coming. <a href="http://twitter.com/anjali28">Anjali Ramachandran</a>, a strategist at London-based digital agency <a href="http://www.madebymany.co.uk/">Made by Many</a>, posted a <a href="http://crowdsourcingexamples.pbwiki.com/">wiki</a> with 135 companies currently engaging in some form of crowdsourcing. It&#39;s a great start, and Anjali is asking us all to help expand it. Such efforts are crucial to the maturation and understanding of crowdsourcing. The phenomenon has grown so rapidly (and so haphazardly) that it&#39;s exceeded any single person&#39;s capacity to track it. I know there are a lot of crowdsourcing junkies reading this post. I&#39;d encourage you all to go contribute.</p><p><strong>Um, Do You Know How We Can Get Out of This Mess?</strong><br />Ireland&#39;s economy has been especially hard hit by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01ferguson.html">Great Recession</a>. Enter &quot;The Ideas Campaign,&quot; or &quot;the <a href="http://http://www.ideascampaign.ie/">People&#39;s Campaign for Economic Growth</a>,&quot; an open innovation project operated and paid for by Irish Web consulting firm, AMAS. Here&#39;s Springwise: &quot;Launched just a week ago, the Ideas Campaign is asking the citizens of Ireland to propose innovative ideas to boost
economic activity in the country across 19 key areas including
manufacturing, technology, construction, retail and education.&quot; Great idea. Horrible execution. The ideas are collected, vetted and posted back to the site without any opportunity for the community to vote, comment or otherwise interact with them. A perfect use for aforementioned Google Moderator. Would the <a href="http://norml.org/">Dope Lobby</a>—or more to the point, some special interest—have gamed this site like they did President Obama&#39;s? Possibly, but that&#39;s an argument for enhanced moderation, not locking out the crowd&#39;s input on, well, the crowd&#39;s input. If it works for Ireland, maybe <a href="http://forums.intpcentral.com/showthread.php?t=31678&amp;page=3">Iceland</a> will give crowdsourcing a spin.</p><p><strong>Smartsourcing vs. Crowdsourcing</strong><br />Pete Peterson has a <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/government-needs-smart-sourcing-not-crowdsourcing">very thoughtful</a> essay at techPresident this week in which he examined the Obama administration&#39;s mixed results from such crowdsourcing experiments as the <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/wrapping_up_the_citizens_briefing_book/">Citizen&#39;s Briefing Book</a> (another ideajam that was stampeded by the drug lobby). He advocates bringing together &quot;select group of citizens.&quot;</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />The government can serve a vital role as
convener – bringing together smart people from a variety of viewpoints
to collaborate and debate online over particular policy initiatives.
These policy discussions – whether in wiki or blog format – can be kept
transparent and open to the public’s view, but as we have seen during
the Transition, these must be controlled in such a way as to prevent
hijacking by small, organized groups.&quot;<br /></div><p><br />I couldn&#39;t agree more. I would just like to point out that smartsourcing (great term!) <em>is </em>crowdsourcing. In my <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">original article</a> on crowdsourcing as well as in my talks, I&#39;ve always said, &quot;First—pick the right crowd.&quot; This has theoretical underpinnings. Scott E. Page, who&#39;s probably done more work than anyone in collective intelligence, calls this a &quot;crowd of models.&quot; Diversity will trump ability, he notes, but only if a certain level of talent and ability are mixed in with that diversity. At any rate, Peterson&#39;s post is the read of the week, in my view.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m just rolling in from an open jaw that took me from Austin to Boston and back. (I went to SXSW to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQu0292dftA">moderate</a> a panel and <a href="http://sxsw.com/node/1254">read</a> from my book, then to the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center</a> for a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2009/03/howe">talk</a>. More on these later.) What did I miss? To judge by my tweetdeck alerts, quite a lot. Here are some highlights, in no particular order:</p><p><strong>Crowdsourcing Schadenfreude<br /></strong>A few days after sitting on my SXSW panel the Forrester analyst Jeremiah Owyang published an <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2009/03/16/expect-changes-at-mzinga/">unfortunate post</a> about Mzinga, one of the companies he follows. Within he reported that he&#39;d been hearing rumors of financial difficulties at the company, and advised his clients to &quot;<em><em>stall</em> </em>any additional movement till they brief me next Monday&quot; (italics his). Without recounting the resulting shit storm (Which you can read about <a href="http://copywriteink.blogspot.com/2009/03/ruffling-feathers-jeremiah-owyang.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dooleycommunications.ca/2009/03/17/the-owyang-blunder-the-phallic-typewriter-gets-castrated/">here</a>), I would like to pass censure on the (purported) <a href="http://bigtweet.com/c/b/twitter/tomhumbarger/tQ8XU">use of crowdsourcing</a> to determine whether Forrester should give Owyang the ax. Basically, a social media consultant asked his readers to vote on Owyang&#39;s fate. A) This is only crowdsourcing if Forrester were to base a decision on it (which they surely won&#39;t); B) it gives form to the sort of anonymous trollery that all is social media&#39;s least attractive feature.</p><p><strong>Crowdsourcing Congress<br /></strong>I&#39;ve been ignoring the rise of crowdsourcing in governance for the excellent reason that I&#39;d have to drop my day job in order to due the subject justice. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve been lurking. Guest blogging at O&#39;Reilly, Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose brought Gov 2.0
one step closer to fruition by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/crowdsourcing-evolution-of-congressional-websites.html">asking the crowd</a> how Congressional Websites might best take advantage of, well, crowdsourcing.</p><p><strong>Crowdsourcing Recycling</strong><br />Brilliant, common-sense <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/crowdsourcing_recycling_ideas_12926.asp">use of community</a> to disseminate recession-era home ec.</p><p><strong>Army of ... Many?</strong><br />Tantalizing, right? Tune in later when I actually have time to complete a friggin&#39; blog post. </p>

				<p>Last week a friend and erstwhile colleague, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/us/politics/23web-seelye.html">Amanda Michel</a> hit not one but two home runs. Michel was the driving (and as our mutual friend David Cohn notes, <a href="http://www.digidave.org/adventures_in_freelancing/2009/03/a-well-deserved-congrats-too.html">unheralded</a>) force behind the Huffington Post&#39;s citizen journalism project, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/off-the-bus/">Off the Bus</a>. OTB was arguably the first truly successful attempt at citizen journalism, and the Columbia Journalism of Review wisely tapped her to write an in-depth feature on her experience running it, called &quot;<a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/get_off_the_bus.php">Get Off The Bus - the future of Pro-Am Journalism.</a>&quot;</p><p><a href="http://crowdsourcing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4cdf53ef011168f2a958970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Amanda Michel" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4cdf53ef011168f2a958970c " src="http://crowdsourcing.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4cdf53ef011168f2a958970c-800wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Amanda Michel" /></a>
 Amanda, David and I worked together on Jay Rosen&#39;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/07/assignment_zero_final">Assignment Zero</a>. When it ended I wrote that it had been a &quot;beautiful failure,&quot; which was to say that while we hadn&#39;t achieved our goals, we&#39;d learned a lot about how the crowd might be tapped to produce quality, investigative journalism. I&#39;ve been inexpressibly pleased to watch Amanda make lemonade out of those lemons with Off the Bus. </p><p>As it happens, she now has the opportunity to further develop the distributed reporting model. The same day the CJR piece came out the non-profit, investigative journalism outfit, ProPublica, announced it had hired her to head up its own citizen journalism <a href="http://www.propublica.org/about/propublica-adds-amanda-michel-to-its-newsroom">effort</a>. This is a big deal in our small world of pro-am journalism. Michel is possessed with a big brain, a big heart (an essential attribute when managing dozens-nay-hundreds of unpaid contributors) and a tireless work ethic.</p><p>Here&#39;s Knight Foundation&#39;s Michelle McLellan on <a href="http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/leadership_blog/propublica_joins_the_pro-am_journalism_movement/#When:16:10:10Z">what it all means</a> for the journalism community at large.&#0160; </p><p></p>

Crowdsourcing, by its very name, encourages a comparison to outsourcing. But when <em>Wired</em> first published the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">article</a> that entered the term into the popular lexicon, it was far from clear whether the phenomenon would realize its disruptive potential. Three years later it seems increasingly obvious that it will. Aided by a new generation of sophisticated start-ups, ever cheaper creative tools, and — most of all — a recession that is forcing cost-saving measures on businesses, crowdsourcing is rapidly migrating from the fringe to the <a href="http://www.finance-commerce.com/article.cfm/2009/03/10/General-Mills-Best-Buy-among-companies-using-crowdsourcing-sites-to-foster-innovation">mainstream.</a> 

</p>

<p>Witness the upheaval currently afflicting the design industry, sparked by the rise of so-called &quot;spec design&quot; sites like <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/how-it-works">crowdSPRING</a> and <a href="http://99designs.com/">99designs</a>. On these sites customers post creative briefs directly to the community, which then competes to create a design that best fits the clients&#39; needs. A typical &quot;assignment&quot; will draw dozens of submissions. The winner receives a nominal fee (as little as $200), and the client
receives a logo or Website design at a fraction of what a professional
agency might charge. The losers get zip, which goes a long way to
explaining why working on spec (aka &#39;on speculation,&quot; or without
guarantee of payment) has always been considered the work of last
resort for writers, designers and other creative professionals.</p>

<p>So one might expect crowdSPRING and 99designs to wither away like so many other seemingly ill-conceived Web 2.0 start ups. Instead, they seem to be flourishing. 99designs <a href="http://99designs.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/over-4-million-dollars-awarded-to-designers/">says it has paid out over $4 million</a> to its community of 30,000 artists, and crowdSPRING expects to be profitable by next year. The success of crowdsourced design has sparked a vibrant, highly emotional debate within the design industry. (The brouhaha will go live at SXSW next week, when I moderate <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/panels?action=show&amp;id=IAP0900690">a panel</a> on the subject of spec work in design.)* </p>

<p>Alarmed by the popularity of the spec model, a group of designers formed a protest group called <a href="http://www.no-spec.com/">NO!SPEC</a> to persuade their colleagues (and prospective clients) to just say no to design contests. Their effort has not been in vain. The trade group <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/about">AIGA</a> — composed of some 22,000 designers — has gone so far as to stake out <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work">an official position</a> on spec-work: &quot;AIGA strongly discourages the practice of requesting that design work be produced and submitted on a speculative basis in order to be considered for acceptance on a project.&quot;</p>

<p>The controversy shifted into high gear last month after Forbes published an airy, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0216/062.html">one-sided look</a> at crowdSPRING. In over 100 comments to the article one could read persuasive, articulate variations on a single theme: &quot;Fuck you and crowdSPRING too.&quot; <a href="http://www.davidairey.com/forbes-calls-designers-snooty/">Several</a> <a href="http://stephdelineated.blogspot.com/2009/02/forbes-promotes-graphic-design-kitsch.html">prominent</a> <a href="http://www.brianyerkes.com/why-crowdspring-owners-should-be-ashamed-of-their-business/">design blogs</a> posted their own jeremiads lambasting crowdSPRING. &quot;Spec work has become a major force in devaluing the perception of graphic design in the business world,&quot; writes <a href="http://stephdelineated.blogspot.com/2009/02/forbes-promotes-graphic-design-kitsch.html">eyeCinq</a>. &quot;The folks that run these outfits have managed to figure out a way to get thousands of people — some skilled enough to earn a decent living — to work for them gratis. It’s an amazing sleight-of-hand,&quot; writes <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/index.php/design-snooty-business-forbes/">the logo factor</a>. </p>

<p>It would seem that the squabble has united the design community against the barbarians at their gate. And that would seem to bode ill for the future health of the spec sites, right?</p><p>Don’t count on it. A similar debate was taking place in the stock
photography world when we published “The Rise of Crowdsourcing” back in
that bygone era of June 2006. The fact this debate has been largely
settled — in favor of the barbarians — speaks volumes about where
graphic design, and, for better or worse, most other creative fields,
are heading. </p>

<p>I made <a href="http://crowdsourcing.typepad.com/cs/2008/08/crowdsourced-de.html">this explicit comparison</a>
on my blog last August. The demand for low-end design has ballooned in
recent years alongside the profusion of start-ups and small businesses.
Conveniently enough, so has the supply of what we might call &quot;low-end
designers&quot; (amateurs, recent grads and the like). According to Forbes
there are 80,000 freelance designers in the US alone. Most of these
are, proverbially speaking, waiting tables. When someone matches demand
and supply, well that&#39;s kismet! </p>

<p>iStockphoto and other so-called &quot;microstock&quot; agencies capitalized on
a similar disparity. The result was the total disruption of the $2
billion stock photo industry. iStock is now the third-largest purveyor
of stock images, and some 96 percent of its &quot;workforce&quot; is comprised of
amateurs. In my crowdsourcing book I posed the question of whether
stock photography was an isolated case, or just the canary in the coal
mine. It was an open question as of April 2008 when I submitted the
final changes to my galleys. Now it ain&#39;t. The canary is prone, lying
motionless on a bed of its own droppings. It looks like it&#39;s time to
find another mine.</p>

<p>* Two of my co-panelists have written their own distinctive takes on the debate. Please check out Threadless.com&#39;s <a href="http://www.callmejeffrey.com/2009/02/27/its-ok-to-be-grey/">Jeffrey Kalmikoff</a> on the spec debate, as well as Forrester analyst Jeremiah Owyang&#39;s <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/12/13/designers-why-spec-work-is-not-going-away-how-you-should-respond/">advice to designers</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last week Harvard&#39;s <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> launched <a href="http://www.herdict.org/web/">Herdict</a>, which encourages Internet users around the world to report blocked, or otherwise inaccessible Websites. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;herd&quot; and &quot;verdict,&quot; and true to its name, Herdict allows people to track blackouts in order to determine whether the problem is innocuous and temporary, or the result of government censorship. Dig the trailer (Does anyone launch anything without a trailer anymore?)</p><p><object height="295" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NggzBHSXdCo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="295" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NggzBHSXdCo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" /></object></p><p></p><p></p><p>The project is the brainchild of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Future-Internet-How-Stop/dp/0300151241/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236141662&amp;sr=1-1">author</a>, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2008/06/11_zittrain.php">law professor</a>, and all around brillionaire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a>, who not only co-founded Berkman ten years ago, but also conducted pioneering research on Internet filtering earlier in this decade. He eventually helped create the OpenNet Initiative (ONI), which tracks online censorship in countries like <a href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/china">China</a>, <a href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/iran">Iran</a> and <a href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. Herdict is an outgrowth of ONI&#39;s work. But whereas ONI gathers anecdotal evidence and technical analysis for academic study, Herdict hopes to aggregate massive amounts of user data to create real time reports. It is essentially, if I understand the technology correctly, a public version of the testing software that ONI operatives (my word choice) used to test sites used to monitor government filtering from within the borders of repressive states. Herdict, then, is part of a larger movement to enlist crowds in an effort to create transparency in government. While it can&#39;t stop censorship, it can cast a light on it.</p><p>The site&#39;s designers clearly took to heart one of the most elemental (and most ignored) principles of crowdsourcing: modularity. Translation: Break a task down into snack-sized bites so it can be performed by what one might call the &quot;coffee break labor force.&quot; You can test a few dozen sites in less than five minutes. Modularity is what made <a href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/">Google Image Labeler</a> and the <a href="http://clickworkers.arc.nasa.gov/top">NASA Clickworker</a> such a success. It&#39;s fun, and it takes something like .003 seconds to contribute. (For you crowdsourcing geeks out there: Berkman fellow Yochai Benkler has written about modularity and how the relationship between the granularity of tasks and a project&#39;s ability to elicit participation. See pages 100-103 in <em><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/wealth_of_networks/Sentence-sliced_Text_Chapter_4">The Wealth of Networks</a>.</em>)</p><p>To succeed Herdict will depend on large-scale participation—and not
just by the folks in the English-speaking blogosphere. To this end Herdict has <a href="http://dotsub.com/view/fae94499-8a80-4cc8-b083-48b0d4d6298b">put out the call</a> to help translate the site into other languages (using the excellent community translation site, <a href="http://dotsub.com/">dotSUB</a>). If you&#39;re bilingual and happen to believe in a free Internet (and really, who doesn&#39;t?), pitch in to help put the herd into Herdict.</p>

				<p>The funeral dirge for newspapers continued as the 150-year-old <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/feb/26/rocky-mountain-news-closes-friday-final-edition/">published</a> its final edition last Friday. The casualty list is sure to grow. The Washington <em>Post&#39;s</em> Howard Kurtz summed up the dire signals in his State of the News story today: &quot;Newspapers are killing sections and closing bureaus, particularly in
Washington. The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press have cut back
home delivery to three days a week. The Washington Times has dropped
its Saturday print edition. The Christian Science Monitor is switching
to Web-only publication in April. Gannett Co., publisher of USA Today,
is forcing staffers to take a week-long furlough. Hearst plans to close
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer unless it gets a buyer.&quot;</p><p>So it seemed somewhat incongruous to learn that 8020 Publishing—purveyor of the lush, user-generated photo magazine, <em>JPG Magazine—</em><a href="http://www.foliomag.com/2009/8020-lands-investors-jpg-relaunch">had found an investor</a> that would allow it to keep trucking. Former CEO Mitchell Fox, wrote in an email that a joint venture between camera retailer Adorama and private investors had formed &quot;for the purpose of executing on the unique vision that led to the creation of JPG Magazine, jpgmag.com and everywheremag.com.&quot; Was it a fire sale? Possibly. Fox has said 8020 had lots of suitors, but they evidently weren&#39;t serious enough to keep 8020 from <a href="http://www.foliomag.com/2009/8020-media-shuts-down">shuttering</a> earlier this year. </p><p>But who cares? The fact remains that <em>JPG</em>—the magazine and the vibrant community around it—provides a robust model for how communities and publishers can collaborate to create compelling content. In these most grim of times, newspapers could do worse than to follow its lead.</p>
