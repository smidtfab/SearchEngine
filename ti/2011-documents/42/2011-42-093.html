				<p>What is crowdsourcing?</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">Crowdsourcing</a>&#8221; is a term coined by Wired magazine writer Jeff Howe and editor Mark Robinson in June 2006. It describes a business model akin to outsourcing, but relying upon unpaid or low-paid amateurs who use their spare time to create content, solve problems, or even do corporate R&#038;D. Crowds targeted for crowdsourcing include garage scientists, amateur videographers, freelancers, photo enthusiasts, data companies, writers, smart mobs and the electronic herd.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Crowdsourcing attempts to replace selectively hired, trained and managed workforces with mass volunteer participation and self-organization. While not a new idea, it is becoming mainstream. Open source projects are a form of crowdsourcing that has existed for years. People who may not know one another work together online to create complex software such as the Linux kernel, and the Firefox browser. In recent years Web 2.0 technology has evolved to allow non-technical people to participate in online projects. Just as important, crowdsourcing presumes that a large number of enthusiasts can outperform a small group of experienced professionals. The tagline for Jeff Howe&#8217;s website, crowdsourcing.com, is The Rise of the Amateur.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in July, over on Tim&#8217;s blog, I <a href="http://iplot.typepad.com/iplot/2006/07/only_an_engaged.html">asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I wonder if this could be applied to the world of politics as well: Citizen engagement, crowdsourced policy development, only an engaged citizen is a good citizen etc.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now two very critical postings by Chris and Tara make me want to get back to this.</p>
<p>Chris: <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2006/10/12/crowdsourcing-the-neue-sweatshop-labor/">Crowdsourcing &#8212; the neue sweatshop labor</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Wired got it wrong when it established the term, putting business interests ahead of the community&#8217;s &#8212; suggesting it&#8217;d discovered a gold mine of cheap labor that could become the next wave after international outsourcing. What Wired should have said of course, casting it in such a light, was that it&#8217;d discovered the next source of legalized sweatshop labor where you never even need to meet face-to-face, let alone account for, the people doing the work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Tara: <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/10/why-buy-cow-when-you-can-get-milk-for.html">Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
The word crowdsourcing makes me sad.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t people just say: &#8220;wanting you to give your time to my project for free&#8221; or &#8220;could you do me a favor that will never be returned?&#8221;. It sounds so much nicer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I agree.  If the terms are transparent and participation is strictly voluntary, I don&#8217;t see why crowdsourcing is necessarily a bad thing.  Obviously, it may require a lot of effort in building relationships and community (much more so than with traditional outsourcing, I would guess, and something that not all corporations may be capable of doing).</p>
<p>On the contrary, I see <em>enormous</em> potential for crowdsourcing in the area of politics, government, and citizen participation.  In a way, projects like <a href="http://www.americaspeaks.org/">AmericaSpeaks</a> (to name just one among many others who were present at the <a href="http://www.thataway.org/">NCDD</a> conference in San Francisco this past August) do just that: they help governments and organizations crowdsource the process of finding <em>smarter</em> solutions and building <em>consensus</em> around them.</p>
<p>And why does that make sense?  Because even if they wanted to, governments and the people involved in politics are oftentimes simply not capable of doing it on their own.  Without consulting their citizens, they seem less likely to find <em>the right solution</em> to a complex, messy and controversial issue, let alone bring about consensus or get group buy-in.  Instead, since citizen involvement is usually not an option due to organizational and budget constraints, they have to go it alone, achieving mediocre results at best.  </p>
<p>This is what we have been used to.  And this, in my opinion, is one of the main reasons why so many people around the world are frustrated with the political class, with the people who represent them, with the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Now what if&#8230;</p>
<p>What if there were an easy and fun way to do this type of collaborative work between governments and their citizens on the web?  What if engaging your citizens became a viable option &#8212; efficient, affordable, rewarding for both sides?  What if, as a government, for the first time in history you could ask the people for help when you need it?</p>
<p>Would citizens be interested?  I believe so, and it&#8217;s worth a try.  I am pretty convinced that more people have a pretty good idea of what makes a good citizen, and they would love to contribute a lot more than they already do &#8212; if only it wasn&#8217;t so hard.</p>
<p>And as for payment?  My guess is you wouldn&#8217;t even need to pay people for this type of work, at least not in money terms.  If you can convince someone that their contribution as a citizen, their time and effort, their learning about an issue, engaging with their peers, trying to understand each other&#8217;s points of view, trying to move things forward, going through all the sweat, tears, pain, and difficulty &#8212; if you can <em>prove</em> to that one citizen that all this wasn&#8217;t just a waste of her time, but instead, that her input <em>really made a difference</em>, then you will have rewarded her already.</p>
