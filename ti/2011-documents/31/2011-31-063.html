				<p><a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br/"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig0lexmlbrasil.png" alt="LexML Brazil Project" height="79" width="265" align="left" border="0" /></a>This post is divided into three topical sections. The first one is an introduction to <a href="http://projeto.lexml.gov.br/">the LexML Brazil Project</a> and its <a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br">unified search portal</a>, after which some aspects related to semantic interoperability shall be presented and, at the end, we show the current work and future direction of the project.</p>
<p>Before going on to the aforementioned subjects, a few words about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</a> and its legislative and<a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/brazil_states_named.png" title="Brazil States"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/brazil_states_named.png" alt="Brazil States" height="128" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="128" align="right" border="1" /></a> legal systems are necessary. Brazil is a country of continental proportions, composed of 27 states and more than five thousand municipalities, or cities, as in Brazil no distinction is made between town and city. As a <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/federation">federative</a> system, each state and municipality has its own legislative chamber. While states and cities follow a unicameral system, the Federation itself has a bicameral system, with the National Congress divided into <a href="http://www2.camara.gov.br/">a Chamber of Deputies</a> and <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/">the Federal Senate</a>. These legislatures generate a great number of laws, or normative acts.  The abundance of normative acts is very significant, considering that, in contrast with <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/common_law">Common Law</a> systems, Brazil&#8217;s legal system, based on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_law">the Civil Law</a>, is characterized by the predominance of normative acts.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.infolegis.com.br/Curriculo.htm">Edilenice Passos</a>, “the proliferation of normative acts, of higher or lower hierarchy, eventually causes total chaos, for this big mass of juridical documents hampers the work of lawyers, of researchers, and of the very citizens, who are ruled by Brazilian laws.” Edilenice Passos <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Brazil.htm">also cites Arnoldo Wald</a>, who, in 1969, was already alerting Brazilians that “the true legislative labyrinth created as a result of an inflation of statutes passed in recent years has turned the ruling Brazilian law into a patchwork, in which the mere legislative updating becomes a daily torture for a lawyer and a judge who are searching for the rules applicable to a specific subject, from among acts, supplementary acts, institutional acts, decree-laws, and other normative acts.”</p>
<p>Almost all Brazilian legal and legislative information is available through the Internet. However, this information is distributed among several thousand sites, each containing documents produced by a specific government institution. Thus, the relationships between acts of different institutions is not available explicitly, making it very hard to understand this “legal patchwork.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, much time is lost looking for this information, filtering the results of search engines. As <a href="http://roytennant.com/">Roy Tennant</a> says, <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA170458.html">“Librarians like to search; everyone else likes to <i>find</i>,”</a> and <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6457238.html">further adds</a>: “People generally want to find everything they can on a topic, ranked by relevance and displayed in ways that make it easy to narrow in on their goal.”</p>
<p>Born to address these issues, <a href="http://projeto.lexml.gov.br/">LexML Brazil</a> is an information network that aims to organize Brazil&#8217;s legislative and legal information. The project is an initiative of the <a href="http://www.ticontrole.gov.br/">“Comunidade TI Controle” (IT Control Community)</a> and is being implemented by the <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br">Brazilian Federal Senate</a>, through <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/prodasen">PRODASEN</a> (the Senate&#8217;s special secretariat for information systems) and <a href="http://www.interlegis.gov.br/">Interlegis</a> (a virtual community of Brazilian legislatures).</p>
<p>LexML Brazil&#8217;s first product is the <a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br/">Legislative and Legal Information Portal</a>, which opened on June 30, 2009, indexing 1.28 million documents. In September 2010, its index ranged through more than 1.5 million documents. By indexing the metadata collected from several institutions using the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">OAI-PMH protocol</a>, the portal unifies access to a variety of  legislative and legal information sources, which is a step toward the goal of guaranteeing Brazilians&#8217; constitutional right of access to information.</p>
<p><strong>LexML Portal</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br/">LexML Portal home page </a>layout is very simple and is similar to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>&#8217;s main page. At this screen, it is possible to restrict the search to Legislation, Jurisprudence, or Bills.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig1home.png" title="LexML “Find” Page"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig1home.png" alt="LexML “Find” Page" height="92" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="140" align="left" border="1" /></a></p>
<p>The search results page allows the user to refine the search by using filters, according to his or her information requirements. Five filters are available: location, issuing authority, document type, date, and acronyms.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig2result.png" title="LexML Result Page"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig2result.thumbnail.png" alt="LexML Result Page" height="163" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="214" align="right" border="1" /></a></p>
<p>The detail page provides links to the official publication version of each document, and to other publications available in information systems of network participants, which, in this particular case, are: National Press, Presidency, Chamber of Deputies, and Federal Senate. General information about the document is available by clicking one of  “Mais Detalhes (More details)” links, which directs the Web browser to the corresponding network participant&#8217;s metadata page. A service providing automatic identification of textual references can be activated by clicking the “Linker” label.</p>

<p><strong>Semantic Interoperability</strong></p>
<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability#Definition">systems interoperability</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability#Syntactic_interoperability">syntactic</a> issues can be managed with the estabilished standards of representation, codification, and exchange (<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a>, <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a>, <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">OAI-PMH</a>, etc.), <a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i202/f08/lectures/202-20081006.pdf">structural</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_interoperability">semantic interoperability</a> demands the adoption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_model">a reference model</a> that allows the integration of several models and the use of a unified terminology for indexing different sources of information. According to <a href="http://j.mp/9sIcJj">Patel et al.</a>, the general purpose of semantic interoperability is “to support complex and advanced context-sensitive query processing over heterogeneous information resources.” Lack of semantic interoperability generates then the “information silos” problem, characterized by the lack of information integration and consequent inability to process complex queries.</p>
<p>The next section presents the design choices made by the LexML Brazil Project to address issues related to semantic interoperability using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Ranganathan">Ranganathan</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://j.mp/apRpyW">&#8220;stratification planes&#8221; classification system</a>, featuring:  an <i>idea plane</i>, a <i>verbal plane</i>, and a <i>notational plane</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Idea Plane</strong></p>
<p>The <i>idea plane</i> is composed of the abstract entities of a domain, independently of how they are nominated or identified.</p>
<p>The metadata standards that propose to address interoperability issues do so either for a specific, restricted domain or for heterogeneous domains. Specialized metadata standards (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/">EAD</a>, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a>, etc.) allow different sources of information about specific domains (bibliographical or archival information) to be integrated and searched in an advanced form. On the other hand, the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> standard is one of the few that try to integrate arbitrarily heterogeneous sources using a minimum set of elements and qualifiers. Its  characteristic simplicity enables easy adoption by multiple actors, but also hinders query processing, preventing the use of the rich chain of relationships among entities. The lack of generality or expressiveness of these standards precludes their use for achieving semantic interoperability of heterogeneous sources of legislative and legal information in Brazil.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use formal ontologies instead of metadata standards. According to <a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/information/publishing-industries/916607-1.html" title="Martin Doerr">Martin Doerr</a>, “recently, more and more projects and theoreticians support the use of formal ontologies as common conceptual schema for information integration.” One such ontology, the <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC CRM</a> model, was designed to help the integration, mediation, and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information. It was developed in 1994 and has since been approved as the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34424">ISO 21127:2006</a> standard. The <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC CRM</a> model is then a natural choice for conceptual schemas of legal and legislative information, if one considers that the text corpus consisting of a nation&#8217;s sources of law is a part of the nation&#8217;s cultural heritage information.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC CRM</a> “document” concept lacks the necessary detail needed to describe the relationships among the several information abstraction levels:  work, expression, manifestation, and item. That requirement is fulfilled by the <a href="http://www.ifla.org/en/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records">FRBR<sub>ER</sub></a> entity-relationship model, which was considered as a reference model in earlier phases of the project (<a href="http://www.e-p-a-p.com/dlib/9788883980466/art4.pdf" title="Joao Lima Publication">“An Adaptation of the FRBR Model to Legal Norms,” João Lima</a>, Proceedings of the V Legislative XML Workshop, Florence, 2005) .</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbr_inro.html">FRBR<sub>OO</sub></a> standard, an ontology created by a working group formed in 2003 by representatives of <a href="http://www.ifla.org/">IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions)</a> and <a href="http://icom.museum/">ICOM (International Council of Museums)</a> for purposes of harmonizing both models, was adopted by the LexML project because it combines the advantages of both models while addressing their shortcomings. As such, <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbr_inro.html">FRBR<sub>OO</sub></a> manifests a great affinity to the LexML domain (<a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/references.html" title="Joao Lima Publication 2">“A Time-aware Ontology for Legal Resources,” João Lima et al.</a>,  Proceedings of the Tenth International ISKO Conference, 2008).</p>
<p>One of the great innovations of the <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/official_release_cidoc.html">CIDOC CRM model</a> is the information structuring around temporal events, a central concept in the model. This contrasts with most other metadata models, which have resources as the central objects of interest. This innovative approach defines events as entities that connect actors, things (concrete and abstract), places, and time intervals.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig4cidoccrm.jpg" title="CIDOC CRM core entities"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig4cidoccrm-small.jpg" title="CIDOC CRM core entities"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/fig4cidoccrm-small.thumbnail.jpg" alt="CIDOC CRM core entities" height="132" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="233" align="left" border="1" /></a></p>
<p>This particular emphasis could be criticized on the ground that the user is generally interested in a specific resource, such as the text of a law. However, the result of a search for information about a law is much more relevant if it includes an organized list of events related to the resource, along with the resource itself.</p>
<p>The importance of choosing a suitable reference model is easily observable in the present discussion about what particular syntax to use to codify persistent identifiers &#8212; <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-spinosa-urn-lex-02">urn:lex</a>, <a href="http://legislink.org/">LegisLink</a>, <a href="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</a>, etc. Before reaching the syntax level, such discussions should focus first on the idea plane, where a greater potential for integration exists. A consensus reached at this level would allow great flexibility for the specification of diverse persistent identifier syntaxes.</p>
<p><strong>Verbal Plane</strong></p>
<p>The CIDOC CRM ontology separates the class of types and denominations from other classes. Multiple names, identifiers, and types can be attributed to all entities of the CRM, allowing any domain class to be classified by several taxonomies and be known by multiple names and identifiers.</p>
<p>This approach is used in LexML to represent different terms that identify the same concepts.  Six classes form LexML&#8217;s uniform resource identifiers:  place, authority, type of document, event, type of content, and language. To externalize the LexML vocabularies specification, we recommend, and use, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">W3C SKOS</a> (Simple Knowledge Organization System).</p>
<p><strong>Notational Plane</strong></p>
<p>The definition of uniform and persistent identifiers is fundamental for the creation and maintenance of an information chain. Identifiers are already <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/03/01/environmentally-friendly-citations/">part of the legal domain</a>. For identification purposes, numbers are attributed to rulings, decisions, abridgments, and bills, allowing references by means of textual remissions. In the computational environment, the creation of persistent and uniform identifiers allows not only identification and reference, but also access to documents by means of textual hyperlinks.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of the <a href="http://www.ittig.cnr.it/Ricerca/UnitaEng.php?Id=40">Italian project Norme in Rete </a> with respect to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-spinosa-urn-lex-02">URN (Uniform Resource Name)</a> identifiers, LexML defines a grammar for the construction of identifiers for legislative and legal documents in Brazil. As an example, the name “urn:lex:br:federal:lei:1993-06-21;8666” identifies, in a persistent and unique way, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:1993-06-21;8666">Federal Act  No. 8666, of June 21, 1993</a>.” If all information systems agree with respect to the identifiers, it is possible to share descriptive metadata, as well as information about semantic relationships, such as regulation, amendment, abrogation, etc.</p>
<p>The Linker service, accessible through <a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br/">the LexML Portal</a> (see, e.g., <a href="http://www2.camara.gov.br/legin/fed/lei/2008/lei-11705-19-junho-2008-576771-publicacao-99902-pl.html">Act 11.705 without linker</a> and <a href="http://linker.lexml.gov.br/linker/processa?urn=urn:lex:br:federal:lei:2008-06-19;11705&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.camara.gov.br%2Flegin%2Ffed%2Flei%2F2008%2Flei-11705-19-junho-2008-576771-publicacao-99902-pl.html&amp;exec">Act 11.705 with linker</a>), creates hyperlinks automatically through a dynamic textual analysis that identifies textual remissions of [i.e., citations to] normative documents. These hyperlinks can be used to navigate through textual remissions.</p>
<p><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>
<p>LexML 1.0 consists of the <a href="http://www.lexml.gov.br/">Search Portal</a>, the Resolution Service, the Persistent Identifier, and the Linker Service. The next version, LexML 2.0, will go further: it will involve the development of open source tools for managing the complete text of documents encoded according to the LexML Brazil XML Schema, which was derived from the schemas of the <a href="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</a> Project.</p>
<p>The complete management of document texts in a structured form has been a goal of the project since its inception. In as early as 2000, the <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/legislacao/const/">Federal Constitution Portal </a> was implemented following this idea. This portal allows the user to see all the versions of the constitutional text through a <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/legislacao/const/">timeline</a>, with the option to see the list of historical changes [see, e.g., <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/legislacao/const/con1988/CON1988_13.07.2010/art_12_.shtm">art. 12</a>] and with the ability to navigate bi-directional links [for example, in <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/legislacao/const/con1988/CON1988_13.07.2010/art_154_.shtm">art. 154</a>, click on the blue arrows].</p>
<p>During the development of that portal, taking into account the various forms of XML used to encode normative texts in many countries, and especially the experience of the <a href="http://www.ittig.cnr.it/Ricerca/UnitaEng.php?Id=40">Italian project Norme in Rete</a>, a decision was made to make a unified portal and a persistent identifier a priority of the LexML project. Presently, our efforts to build open source tools for management of document texts are being renewed.  One of these tools, a <i>LexML Document Editor</i>, will enable the authoring of legal texts as if using a word processor, but producing a structured document at the end. Another tool is the <i>Compiler</i>, which will semi-automatically generate modified versions of documents that have been updated by other legal acts. The <i>Consolidator</i> will help to simplify the display of legal information &#8212; and users&#8217; experience of the legal system &#8212; through the consolidation of several related normative acts into a single act. The <i>Comparator</i> will be used to display the differences between versions of a document. The last tool, the <i>Publisher</i>, will be used to render XML content in different formats, such as html, PDF, <a href="http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=pdfa:en:pdfa_whitepaper">PDF-A</a>, <a href="http://www.idpf.org/specs.htm">EPUB</a>, etc., with the ability to choose different views of the same text, such as the original text, the updated text as of a specific date, etc.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Information Management Committee, which is a community of practice composed of librarians, archivists, and information analysts of several institutions of the three Brazilian governmental branches, interested in the management of legal and legislative information, is responsible for the definition of the priority and long range planning of <a href="http://projeto.lexml.gov.br/">the LexML Brazil Project</a>.</p>

				<p>In this post, I will describe how <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/05/17/weaving-the-legal-semantic-web-with-natural-language-processing/">natural language processing</a> can help in creating computer systems dealing with the law.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilelawbooks.jpg" title="Law Books Emile"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilelawbooks.jpg" alt="Law Books Emile" align="left" border="0" height="116" hspace="15" width="118" /></a>A lot of computer systems are being designed to help users deal with legal texts &#8212; <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~richards1000/CALR.html">accessing</a>, understanding, or applying them. [<i>Editor&#8217;s Note</i>: <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/07/01/rule-based-legal-information-systems/">Michael Poulshock&#8217;s <i>Jureeka</i></a> is an example of a system that automates the application of legal texts.] Other systems &#8212; such as <a href="http://www.dalosproject.eu/">DALOS</a> &#8212; are about creating legal texts, providing support for the writers, or simulating the effects of a text. Such systems are based on something more than &#8220;just&#8221; the legal text: there is <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202432106864">XML mark-up</a>, an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL</a> <a href="http://j.mp/9dkqkF">ontology</a>, or a representation of the rules in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">SWRL</a> or some programming language. This means that any piece of legislation that you want to use on your computer system needs to be translated into this computer representation.</p>
<p>We try to support this translation using <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/05/17/weaving-the-legal-semantic-web-with-natural-language-processing/">natural language processing</a>, so that (part of) the translation can be done by a computer. This automation should have a number of advantages. First of all, computers are cheaper than human experts, and automating the process should reduce the amount of resources needed for this task. Second, the models that are produced by automated processes are more consistent; human experts may treat two similar sentences differently, but a computer program will always behave the same. Finally, an approach employing <i>structures</i> ensures that there is a clear mapping between the elements of the computer model and the original text.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/05/17/weaving-the-legal-semantic-web-with-natural-language-processing/">Natural Language Processing</a> isn&#8217;t perfect yet: computers cannot understand human language. However, legal text is quite structured, and offers a lot more handholds for automated translation than, say, a novel.</p>
<p><strong>Document Structure</strong></p>
<p>The first step that we will have to undertake is to determine the structure of the document. Online services like <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/08/15/legislationgovuk/">Legislation.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.wetten.nl">wetten.nl</a> can make it easier to access legal documents because they can point you to the right part of the document (such as a chapter, paragraph, sentence, etc.). In most law texts, the structure has been made explicit using clear headings, like: <em>Chapter 1</em> or <em>Chapter 1. General Provisions</em>. So, in order to detect structure, we need to detect these headings. This means we&#8217;ll need to search the document for lines starting with <i>Chapter</i>, followed by some designation (which we refer to as an <i>index</i>), and perhaps followed by some text - say, the <i>title</i> of the chapter. The index can <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilenumbers.jpg" title="Numbers"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilenumbers.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Numbers" align="right" border="0" /></a>be a lot of things: Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, &#8230;), Roman numbers (I, II, III, &#8230;) or letters (a, b, c, &#8230;). Sometimes the index is an ordinal appearing before the chapter label: <em>First chapter</em>. It may even be a combination of several numbers and letters (5.2a). This is not a great problem, as we can more or less assume that whatever follows the word <em>Chapter</em> is the index.</p>
<p>The main problem with this approach is that there are also regular sentences that start with the word <i>Chapter</i>, and we need to separate those out. To do so, we can use some heuristics: A title will not end with a full stop (.); a heading will always start on a new line; etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilequeen-beatrix.jpg" title="Queen Beatrix"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilequeen-beatrix.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Queen Beatrix" align="left" border="0" /></a>This procedure to find the headings for chapters is repeated to find headings for sections, subsections, etc. Also, some sections (like numbered paragraphs or list items) will not have a full heading, but just a number, which we also need to recognise. Finally, some sections don&#8217;t have a heading but can be recognised because they start with a fixed language pattern. For example, a preamble in a (recent) Dutch Law &#8212; such as <a href="http://j.mp/bWAjnQ">this</a> &#8212; will start with: <em>We, Beatrix, Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, etc. etc. etc.</em></p>
<p>This procedure assumes that the input for the process is just text. Many documents will contain more information &#8212; such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">textual markup</a> &#8212; and headings may be more easily identified because they are marked as bold text, or even as headings. So, in situations where the input is made up of documents that are marked-up in a consistent way, it may be easier to recognise the patterns by taking layout into account in addition to text.</p>
<p>To actually find the patterns, we can use existing toolkits like <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">GATE</a>. After the patterns have been found, and the structure has been recognised, we can store it using a format such as <a href="http://www.metalex.eu">MetaLex</a>.</p>
<p><strong>References</strong></p>
<p>The second step is to detect the references from a portion of a law text to other portions of that text, or from a law text to other texts. References, like headings, follow a pattern. The simplest patterns are rather similar to headings; the text <em>chapter 13</em> is probably a reference, unless it is part of a heading. <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/referencesemile.jpg" title="References"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/10/referencesemile.thumbnail.jpg" alt="References" align="left" border="0" /></a>Just like headings, basic references consist of a <i>label</i> (section, chapter, article) and an <i>index</i> (13, 13.2.1, XIII,  m). And, just as with headings, we can find the references by looking for these patterns in the text.</p>
<p>However, this is only the simplest form of references. Besides references to a specific section, such as <i>chapter 13</i>, there are of course also references to a complete law. Some of these references follow a pattern as well, such as <em>the law of October 1st, 2007</em>. Most laws are cited by means of a citation title, though, such as the <em>Railroad Act</em>. Such titles can contain all kinds of words, and they don&#8217;t follow a strict pattern. Thus, such references cannot be detected using patterns. Instead, we use a list containing all (citation) titles to detect such references.</p>
<p>Other, more complex references contain multiple references in one statement, such as <em>articles 13 and 14</em>, or multiple levels: <em>article 13, item e, of the Railroad Act</em>, or even more complex combinations of the two: <em>articles 13, item e, 14, item f, 15 and 16, items a and b, of the Railroad Act</em>. Though more complex than the simple combination of label and index, these references still follow clear (sometimes recurring) patterns, and can be found in the text by searching for such patterns.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.leibnizcenter.org/">the Leibniz Center for Law</a>, we&#8217;ve created a parser based on these patterns, which had an accuracy of over <a href="http://lri.jur.uva.nl/~winkels/papers/Automated_Detection_of_Reference_Structures_in_Law.pdf">95%</a>. For each reference found, we can construct some standardised name, and store it. With this technology, not only can we add hyperlinks to documents; we can also search for documents that refer to some specific document.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong></p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got the structure and links in place, it&#8217;s time to start with the actual meaning of the text. Rather than tackling the entire text as a whole, we&#8217;ve selected sentences as the basic building blocks, and we attempt to create computer models for individual sentences first. Later, we can integrate those individual models to a complete model.</p>
<p>As a first step in creating the models, we start by assigning a broad meaning, or <i>classification</i>, to each sentence. Does the sentence give a definition for a concept, describe <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/obligation">an obligation</a>, or make a change in another law? In total, we distinguish fourteen different <i>classes</i> of sentences that appear in Dutch law texts. The next step in our automated approach is to assign a class to each sentence automatically.</p>
<p>To do so, we turn once again to language patterns. Legal language is rather strict, and legislative drafters don&#8217;t vary their language a lot &#8212; in a novel, variation may make for a more appealing text, but in a law, variation invites ambiguity. In fact, there are official Guidelines for Legislative Drafting that (among other things) reduce the variety of texts used. [<i>Editor&#8217;s Note</i>: For example, drafters of legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives Office of the Legislative Counsel have used Donald Hirsch&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.llsdc.org/attachments/files/92/Drafting-Fed-Law.pdf">Drafting Federal Law</a></i>.] This means that for each of our classes, there&#8217;s a rather limited set of language patterns used. For example, definitions will look like one of these:</p>
<p><em>Under &#8230; is understood &#8230;</em></p>
<p><em> This law understands under &#8230; &#8230;</em></p>
<p>There are some variations in word order, but in the end, a small set of patterns is sufficient to describe all commonly used phrases. There is only one class of sentences where we cannot define a full set of patterns: obligations. In Dutch laws, obligations are often expressed without signal words like <i>must</i> or <i>is obliged to</i>. Instead, the obligations are presented as a fact:</p>
<p><em>No bodies are buried on a closed cemetery.</em></p>
<p>However, since the obligations are the only sentences lacking all-compassing patterns, we will assume that any sentence that does not mark a pattern is one of these obligations.</p>
<p>Based on the patterns found, we&#8217;ve created a classifier that attempts to sort sentences into these different classes. This classifier has an accuracy of <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1568234.1568239">91%</a>, and we expect that this can improved a bit further.</p>
<p>(As a side note: For classification tasks as these, a machine learning approach is often preferred; see, e.g., <a href="http://j.mp/cfJqFp">here</a>. With such an approach, you provide the computer, not with patterns, but with a bunch of sample sentences. The computer will then extract its own patterns from those sentences, and use these to classify any new sentences. We&#8217;ve tried this approach as well (using the toolkit <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">WEKA</a>), and reached similarly accurate results.)</p>
<p><strong>Modelling</strong></p>
<p>Having classified the sentences, we now want to create models of the sentences. In essence, this means breaking down each sentence into smaller components and defining relationships between them. In some cases, the patterns used to classify the sentence already give us sufficient information to break up the sentence. Suppose we have a sentence like:</p>
<p><em>In article 7.12, sub one, second sentence, «article 7.3b» is replaced by: article 7.3c.</em></p>
<p>We classify this sentence as a <i>replacement</i> because of the text <i>is replaced by</i>. We can then also conclude that the text between angle quotes is the text to be replaced, the text following the colon is the replacing text, and the reference preceding it (which we&#8217;ve already detected) is the location where the replacement should take place.</p>
<p>This works fine for sentences that are somehow &#8220;about&#8221; the law. But for sentences that deal with some other domain, such as taxes, traffic, or commerce, we cannot predict all the elements. These sentences could be about anything &#8212; and statutes are full of such sentences. For such sentences, we need to follow a generic method. The aim is to model rules as a situation or action that is allowed or not allowed, similar to the models created in the <a href="http://www.estrellaproject.org/?page_id=102">HARNESS</a> system of the <a href="http://www.estrellaproject.org/">ESTRELLA</a> project. For example, for an obligation, we assume that the sentence describes some action that must be done. <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilewarrant.jpg" title="warrant"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemilewarrant.thumbnail.jpg" alt="warrant" align="right" border="0" /></a>We try to identify who should be doing the action, and what other elements are involved. Thus, for the sentence:</p>
<p><em>Our Minister issues a warrant to the negligent person.</em></p>
<p>we would like to extract the following information:</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Obligation</strong><br />
<i>Action:</i> Issue<br />
<i>Agent:</i> Our Minister<br />
<i>Patient:</i> Warrant<br />
<i>Recipient:</i> Negligent person</p>
<p>(Such a table, or frame, is not the same as a computer model, but has all the elements needed to create one.)</p>
<p>Now, identifying these different elements of the sentence (<i>agent</i>, <i>patient</i>, <i>recipient</i>) is something that computer linguists have already worked on for a long time, which means we do not have to start from scratch. Instead, we can use existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsers</a> to do much of the work for us. For our Dutch laws, we use the <a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/alp/Alpino/">Alpino parser</a>. <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemiletree.jpg" title="voxemiletree.jpg"><img src="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/09/voxemiletree.jpg" alt="voxemiletree.jpg" align="right" border="0" /></a>Such a parser will create a <i>parse tree</i> of a sentence. In this parse tree, the sentence will be split up in parts. The parser can identify which part is the subject, the direct object, the indirect object, etc. Based on this information, we can determine the agent, patient, and recipient (so-called <i>semantic roles</i>). In a sentence with a verb in the active voice, the subject is the agent, the direct object is the patient, and the indirect object is the recipient. Furthermore, the parser will determine the relationship between words, such as an adjective that modifies a noun. This information, too, helps us to make more accurate models.</p>
<p>We start out with the output of these parsers, and then try to extract all terms that have some more significance. If we want an application to compute whether or not a situation is allowed, a word like <i>car</i> can be treated in a generic way, but terms like <i>allowed</i> and <i>not</i> some special attention.</p>
<p><strong>To Be Continued&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>We still need to refine the method for making these models, and evaluate the results. After that, the individual models will need to be merged. But even as things stand now, we think these tools will help with getting legal text from paper into your computer systems.</p>

<p><a href='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/05/clouds-in-blue-sky-2.jpg' title='Clouds in Blue Sky'><img src='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/05/clouds-in-blue-sky-2.jpg' alt='Clouds in Blue Sky' align="right" /></a>The relationship of legal information to context is a key dimension of recent developments in legal informatics scholarship and innovation.  These developments range from <a href="http://www.ap-ls.org/aboutpsychlaw/InfoPsychLaw.php">investigations in law and psychology</a> to political and moral theory, from <a href="http://iaail.org/">explorations in artificial intelligence and law</a> to legal information theory, and from research on <a href="http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/tag/semantic-web-and-law/">the legal Semantic Web</a> to the creation of new applications that help nonlawyers contextualize legal information.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/">Professor Helen Nissenbaum</a> has foregrounded the notion of context in the debate over privacy respecting court records. In her new book, <i><a href="http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=8862">Privacy in Context</a></i>,  and <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu/open-government-workshop/#video-available">in her presentation at the 2010 Princeton Open Government Workshop</a>, Nissenbaum defines the right to privacy as the right to what she calls &#8220;contextual integrity,&#8221; meaning the use or &#8220;flow&#8221; of information consistent with the norm for information transfer applicable in the particular context &#8212; such as home, school, workplace, court, etc. &#8212; where the information was first transferred. For Nissenbaum, key characteristics of an information context &#8212; the sender of the information, the intended recipient of the information, the subject of the information, the type of information that is shared, and the purposes and goals served by the information context &#8212; determine which norm governs information flow in that context.  In Nissenbaum&#8217;s view, when information about individuals flows in a manner consistent with its contextual norm, &#8220;contextual integrity&#8221; &#8212; and those individuals&#8217; privacy rights &#8212; are considered to have been preserved, but if that information flows in a manner inconsistent with that norm, contextual integrity &#8212; and thus the privacy rights of those individuals &#8212; are considered to have been breached. Nissenbaum argues that when a new technology &#8212; such as <a href="http://pacer.uscourts.gov/">a publicly available online database of court records</a> &#8212; arises that arguably violates contextual integrity, a presumption should arise in favor of preserving contextual integrity and rejecting the new technology.  On Nissenbaum&#8217;s account, that presumption may be rebutted if the new technology can be shown more effectively to serve both general social values such as social welfare and national security, and also the particular purposes and goals of the original information context.  Nissenbaum allows that the new technology might also  prevail if it, or some aspect of the information available through it, could be modified to render it superior in vindicating both general and contextual values. Applying Nissenbaum&#8217;s model to court records would thus entail a careful consideration of a variety of contexts in which those records are generated, the rejection of certain new information technologies, and also negotiations with technologists to determine whether certain new technologies, or the data they process, could be modified so as to render those technologies superior to the original systems in vindicating general and contextual values.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.di.unito.it/~guido/">Professor Guido Boella</a>, <a href="http://www.governatori.net/research/index.html">Dr. Guido Governatori</a>, and colleagues are exploring ways to model legal contexts to aid automated legal reasoning. In <a href="http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/2010/05/14/boella-governatori-et-al-on-a-formal-study-on-legal-compliance-and-interpretation/">their recent paper</a> these scholars show how defeasible logic can be employed to represent the policy context of legal rules. Their approach could improve computers&#8217; capacity to assess legal compliance, and could contribute to the automation of the interpretation of legal language.</p>
<p>In legal information retrieval, <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0676227/">K. Tamsin Maxwell</a> &#8212; in <a href="http://j.mp/7yfDK1">a recent post</a>, as well as in <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0676227/MaxSchaf_legalIR_NLPvKE.pdf">a recent conference paper</a> co-authored by <a href="http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/burkhardschafer_69.aspx">Burkhard Schafer</a> &#8212; is exploring the use of <a href="http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/index.html">Natural Language Processing</a> techniques to contextualize queries, automate discovery of factually-similar cases, and achieve &#8220;near perfect search recall <i>within the context of precision</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/02/orangescene.jpg' title='Orange Scene'><img src='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/02/orangescene.jpg' alt='Orange Scene' align="left" /></a>Recent research in law and psychology &#8212; particularly the research highlighted by <a href="http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/"><i>The Situationist</i> blog</a> published by <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k13943&amp;pageid=icb.page63708">the Project on Law and Mind Sciences at Harvard Law School</a> &#8212; emphasizes how context affects people&#8217;s understanding and use of legal information. For example, <a href="http://www.earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/faculty/adam-benforado.asp">Professor Adam Benforado</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/the-spatial-situation-of-crime-and-criminal-law/">new paper</a> explores how spatial situations affect the law-related behavior and thinking of various participants in criminal cases, while <a href="http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/the-broader-situation-a-case-study-of-cop-car-cameras/">another of his recent articles</a> argues that the context of the videotape evidence at issue in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1631.ZS.html"><i>Scott v. Harris</i></a> had a profound and unacknowledged influence on the way <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">the U.S. Supreme Court</a> interpreted that evidence.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://j.mp/5yYHzU">her recent post</a> and <a href="http://www.juridicum.su.se/jurweb/forskning/dr_projekt_visa.asp?lang=eng&amp;forskid=&amp;projekt_id=98">her dissertation in progress</a>, <a href="http://iinek-law.info/">Christine Kirchberger</a> explores the importance of context for making legal information usable by nonlawyers. Kirchberger highlights legal Semantic Web technology &#8212; such as that discussed in <a href="http://j.mp/9dkqkF">Dr. Núria Casellas’s recent post on legal ontologies</a> &#8212; and government eportals &#8212; like <a href="http://help.gv.at/">Austria&#8217;s HELP service</a> &#8212; as promising means of offering valuable context to nonlawyers using legal information.  Kirchberger quotes <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/tbruce/about/">Tom Bruce</a>&#8217;s  <a href="http://www.itkommissionen.se/dynamaster/file_archive/021209/31dbadf93937c4e70a355682c14c7aba/legal%20and%20internet.pdf">2001 paper</a> on the need to build flexible systems that can present legal information in a range of different contexts, suited to the needs of different users of those systems.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/worldlii/declaration/">free access to law services</a> are providing this kind of contextual information by building secondary sources into their systems.  For example, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/">the Cornell Legal Information Institute</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex"><i>Wex</i> legal encyclopedia</a> &#8212; written collaboratively by volunteers &#8212; explains key legal concepts and terms that appear in the Institute&#8217;s primary collections.  As <a href="http://blog.tomtebo.org/">Staffan Malmgren</a> explains <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/03/31/crowdsourcing-legal-commentary/">in this recent post</a>, his <a href="http://www.lagen.nu"><i>lagen.nu</i></a> free access to law service for Sweden includes commentaries, written by means of an innovative crowdsourcing method.</p>
<p>Automatic linking is another method of furnishing context to users of legal information, as hotlinked citations enable quick retrieval of full text sources that make up legal context.  Free access to law services such as <a href="http://www.canlii.com"><i>CanLII</i></a> provide such technology for linking to primary legal sources &#8212; as <a href="http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/team/index.html#mokanoi">Ivan Mokanov</a> explains <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/03/01/environmentally-friendly-citations/">in this recent post</a>. In his <a href="http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/6392/">recent thesis</a>, <a href="http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/6464/">conference paper</a>, and <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/03/14/collaboration-and-open-access-to-law/">post</a>, <a href="http://www.culturelibre.ca/contactez-culturelibre/#bio-en">Olivier Charbonneau</a> proposes several ideas for delivering contextual information to users of free legal systems.  These include personalized user interfaces; automatic display of citing sources when a cursor is placed over a passage of a primary legal document; automatic display of relevant commentaries below or alongside a primary legal text; and user ratings of user-contributed commentary, to help nonlawyers assess the quality of content.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.florisbex.com/">Dr. Floris Bex</a> in <a href="http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/faculties/jur/2009/f.j.bex/">his recent dissertation</a> and <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/04/16/argument-mapping-and-storytelling-in-criminal-cases/">post</a> explains how argument- and narrative-mapping technology can provide valuable context for prosecutors conducting criminal investigations. Dr. Bex describes his and his colleagues&#8217; research &#8212; and particularly <a href="http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/van-den-braak-on-sensemaking-software-for-crime-analysis/">the work</a> of <a href="http://www.susanb.nl/">Dr. Susan van den Braak</a> &#8212; respecting a variety of applications that provide visual displays of investigators&#8217; legal and factual arguments and narrative accounts of alleged crimes.  These tools allow investigators to contextualize each relevant fact and point of law within a conceptual framework for their case.</p>
<p><a href='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/02/bluescene.jpg' title='Blue Scene'><img src='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/02/bluescene.jpg' alt='Blue Scene' align="right" /></a>Two current U.S. federal court technology efforts aim to help nonlawyers put legal information in context. <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/ttb/2009-07/article04.cfm">JERS, the Jury Evidence Recording System</a>, enables jurors in four U.S. federal district courts to view digital representations of trial evidence and exhibits in the jury deliberation room, and navigate through the information &#8212; including via zooming and scrolling &#8212; by means of video touchscreen. This access to evidentiary information not only helps each individual juror attain a contextual understanding of the applicable law and facts of the case; it also increases the likelihood that all members of a jury will share the same understanding of the context of the case. On April 27, 2010, <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/ttb/2010-04/article07.cfm">the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts announced that funding for JERS had been renewed</a>. </p>
<p>Whereas JERS helps jurors place legal information in context, <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/News/TheThirdBranch/10-04-01/E-Pro_Se_Bolsters_Access_to_Court.aspx">the E Pro Se document assembly application</a> assists self-represented litigants in contextualizing such information.  A customization of <a href="http://www.a2jauthor.org/">the A2J Author document assembly  program</a> created for use in law school clinics by <a href="http://www.cali.org">CALI, the Center for Computer Assisted Legal Instruction</a>, and <a href="http://www.kentlaw.edu/cajt/">the Chicago-Kent College of Law&#8217;s Center for Access to Justice and Technology</a>, E Pro Se conducts automated interactive interviews with pro se litigants in U.S. federal district court &#8212; for purposes of gathering contextual information from the litigants &#8212; and then processes that information to assemble pleadings and other court papers for the litigants.  E Pro Se is <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/prose/EProSe.html">now available online from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a>. According to <i><a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/News/TheThirdBranch/10-04-01/E-Pro_Se_Bolsters_Access_to_Court.aspx">The Third Branch</a></i>, <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/">the federal district court in Minnesota</a> has begun a pilot E Pro Se project,  and such a project will shortly begin in <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">the Massachusetts federal district court</a>. (Thanks to CALI&#8217;s Executive Director <a href="http://twitter.com/johnpmayer">John P. Mayer</a> for information on this topic.)</p>
<p>Nonlawyers who participate in policy discussions about proposed laws also need context to understand those laws.  Researchers participating in <a href="http://www.policy-impact.eu/">the EU&#8217;s IMPACT Project</a> are creating <a href="http://www.policy-impact.eu/application-scenario">tools</a> to provide this context. <a href="http://www.policy-impact.eu/application-scenario">These tools</a> include argument mapping applications and Semantic Web technology &#8212; described in <a href="http://wyner.info/LanguageLogicLawSoftware/index.php/2010/04/21/recent-paper-submissions/">new papers by Professor Tom van Engers and Dr. Adam Wyner</a> &#8212; for organizing policy discussions into subject-related threads, with visual displays of the reasoning underlying the arguments that make up the discussion, translation of policy arguments into the preferred language of each user, and Web 2.0 services facilitating users&#8217; participation in the discussions.</p>
<p>Context thus appears to be a focal point for legal informatics research, at the levels of theory, policy, and systems development. Research activity in this area appears to be vigorous, and embraces many disciplines in addition to law, including computer science, philosophy, political science, psychology, linguistics, sociology, anthropology, and information science.  As <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/1901/">the disintermediation of legal information professionals</a>, <a href="http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/delivery/delunbund.html">the unbundling of legal services</a>, and <a href="http://www.demo-net.org/what-is-it-about/eparticipation-areas">the participation of citizens in policy- and lawmaking</a> proceed, the need can only grow for greater knowledge of how context affects individuals&#8217; understanding and use of legal information, and for systems that effectively provide nonlawyers with relevant legal contextual information. </p>

				<p><img src="http://www.joint-pain-forum.com/images/horn-of-plenty.jpg" alt="Cornucopia" align="right" /><a href="http://www.w3.org/WWW/">The World Wide Web</a> is a virtual cornucopia of legal information bearing on all manner of topics and in a spectrum of formats, much of it textual. However, to make use of this storehouse of textual information, it must be <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_annotation">annotated</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202432106864">structured</a></em> in such a way as to be meaningful to people and processable by computers.     One of the visions of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/FAQ">Semantic Web</a> has been to enrich information on the Web with annotation and structure.  Yet, given that text is in <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural%20language">a natural language</a> (e.g., English, German, Japanese, etc.), which people can understand but machines cannot, some automated processing of the text itself is needed before further processing can be applied.  In this article, we discuss one approach to legal information on the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and <a href="http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/index.html">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>.  Each of these are large, complex, and heterogeneous topics of research; in this short post, we can only hope to touch on a fragment and that heavily biased to our interests and knowledge.  Other important approaches are mentioned at the end of the post.  We give small working examples of legal textual input, the Semantic Web output, and how NLP can be used to process the input into the output.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Information on the Web</strong></p>
<p>For clients, legal professionals, and public administrators, the Web provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for, find, and reason with legal information such as case law, legislation, legal opinions, journal articles, and material relevant to discovery in a court procedure.  With a search tool such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google</a> or indexed searches made available by <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/">Lexis-Nexis</a>, <a href="http://www.westlaw.co.uk/">Westlaw</a>, or the <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/">World Legal Information Institute</a>, the legal researcher can input key words into a search and get in return <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2009/06/01/search-result-lists-are-dead-to-me/">a (usually long) list of documents</a> which contain, or are indexed by, those key words.</p>
<p>As useful as such searches are, they are also highly limited to the particular words or indexation provided, for the legal researcher must still <em>manually</em> examine the documents to find the substantive information.  Moreover, <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2009/09/17/pushing-the-envelope-innovation-in-legal-search/">current legal search mechanisms</a> do not support more meaningful searches such as for properties or relationships, where, for example, a legal researcher searches for cases in which a company has the property of <em>being in the role of plaintiff</em> or where a lawyer is <em>in the relationship of representing a client</em>.  Nor, by the same token, can searches be made with respect to more general (or more specific) <a href="http://j.mp/9dkqkF">concepts</a>, such as &#8220;all cases in which a company has any role,&#8221; some particular fact pattern, legislation bearing on related topics, or decisions on topics related to a legal subject.</p>
<p><a href='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/05/code-breakers-1.png' title='Binary Mystery'><img src='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/05/code-breakers-1.png' alt='Binary Mystery' align="left" /></a>The underlying problem is that legal textual information is expressed in <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural%20language">natural language</a>. What literate people read as meaningful words and sentences appear to a computer as just strings of ones and zeros. Only by imposing some structure on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">the binary code</a> is it converted to textual characters as we know them.  Yet, there is no similar widespread system for converting the characters into higher levels of structure which correlate to our understanding of meaning.  While a search can be made for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">the string</a> <em>plaintiff</em>, there are no (widely available) searches for a string that represents an individual who bears the role of plaintiff.  To make language on the Web more meaningful and structured, additional content must be added to the source material, which is where <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/FAQ">the Semantic Web</a> and <a href="http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/index.html">Natural Language Processing</a> come into play.</p>
<p><strong>Semantic Web</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/FAQ">The Semantic Web</a> is a complex of design principles and technologies which are intended to make information on the Web more meaningful and usable to people.<a href='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/02/semwebstack.jpg' title='Semantic Web Stack'><img src='http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/files/2010/02/semwebstack.jpg' alt='Semantic Web Stack' align="right" /></a>  We focus on only a small portion of this structure, namely the syntactic <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202432106864">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a> level, where elements are <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_annotation">annotated</a></em> so as to indicate linguistically relevant information and structure. (<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/legaltechnology/pubArticleLT.jsp?id=1202432106864">Click here</a> for more on these points.) While the XML level may be construed as a &#8216;lower&#8217; level in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/techstack-desc.html">the Semantic Web &#8220;stack&#8221;</a> &#8212; i.e., the layers of interrelated technologies that make up the Semantic Web &#8212; the XML level is nonetheless crucial to providing information to higher levels where <a href="http://j.mp/9dkqkF">ontologies</a> (and <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/legaltechnology/pubArticleLT.jsp?id=1202431256007">click here</a> for more on this) and <a href="http://people.cs.uu.nl/henry/abstracts/booksum.html">logic</a> play a role.  So as to be clear about the relation between the Semantic Web and NLP, we briefly review aspects of XML by example, and furnish motivations as we go.</p>
<p>Suppose one looks up a case where <em>Harris Hill</em> is the plaintiff and <em>Jane Smith</em> is the attorney for Harris Hill. In a document related to this case, we would see text such as the following portions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Harris Hill, plaintiff.<br />
Jane Smith, attorney for the plaintiff.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is relatively straightforward to structure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">the binary string</a> into characters, adding further information is more difficult.  Consider what we know about this small fragment:  <em>Harris</em> and <em>Jane</em> are (very likely) first names, <em>Hill</em> and <em>Smith</em> are last names, <em>Harris Hill</em> and <em>Jane Smith</em> are full names of people, <em>plaintiff</em> and <em>attorney</em> are roles in a legal case, Harris Hill has the role of plaintiff, <em>attorney for</em> is a relationship between two entities, and Jane Smith is in the <em>attorney for</em> relationship to Harris Hill.  It would be useful to encode this information into a standardised machine-readable and processable form.</p>
<p>XML helps to encode the information by specifying requirements for <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml#Key_terminology">tags</a></em> that can be used to <em>annotate</em> the text.  It is a highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power">expressive</a> language, allowing one to define tags that suit one&#8217;s purposes so long as the specification requirements are met.  One requirement is that each tag has a beginning and an ending; the material in between is the data that is being tagged.  For example, suppose tags such as the following, where &#8230; indicates the data:</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;legalcase&gt;...&lt;/legalcase&gt;,
&lt;firstname&gt;...&lt;/firstname&gt;,
&lt;lastname&gt;...&lt;/lastname&gt;,
&lt;fullname&gt;...&lt;/fullname&gt;,
&lt;plaintiff&gt;...&lt;/plaintiff&gt;,
&lt;attorney&gt;...&lt;/attorney&gt;,
&lt;legalrelationship&gt;...&lt;/legalrelationship&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>Another requirement is that the tags have a <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">tree structure</a></em>, where each pair of tags in the document is included in another pair of tags and there is no <em>crossing over</em>:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;fullname&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;...&lt;/firstname&gt;,
&lt;lastname&gt;...&lt;/lastname&gt;&lt;/fullname&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>is acceptable, but</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;fullname&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;...&lt;lastname&gt;
&lt;/firstname&gt; ...&lt;/lastname&gt;&lt;/fullname&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>is unacceptable.  Finally, XML tags can be organised into <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema">schemas</a></em> to structure the tags.</p>
<p>With these points in mind, we could represent our fragment as:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;legalcase&gt;
  &lt;legalrelationship&gt;
    &lt;plaintiff&gt;
      &lt;fullname&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Harris&lt;/firstname&gt;,
           &lt;lastname&gt;Hill&lt;/lastname&gt;&lt;/fullname&gt;
    &lt;/plaintiff&gt;,
    &lt;attorney&gt;
      &lt;fullname&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Jane&lt;/firstname&gt;,
           &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;&lt;/fullname&gt;
    &lt;/attorney&gt;
  &lt;/legalrelationship
&lt;/legalcase&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We have added structured information &#8212; the tags &#8212; to the original text.  While this is more difficult for us to read, it is very easy for a machine to read and process.  In addition, the tagged text contains the content of the information, which can be presented in a range of alternative ways and formats using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_language">a transformation language</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xslt">XSLT</a> (<a href="http://wyner.info/LanguageLogicLawSoftware/index.php/2010/01/20/using-xslt-to-re-represent-gate-output/">click here</a> for more on this point) so that we have an easier-to-read format.</p>
<p>Why bother to include all this additional information in a legal text?  Because these additions allow us to <em><a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/glossary.html#Q">query</a></em> the source text and submit the information to further processing such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference#Automatic_logical_inference">inference</a>.  Given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language">a query language</a>, we could submit to the machine the query <em>Who is the attorney in the case?</em> and the answer would be <em>Jane Smith</em>.  Given a rule language &#8212; such as <a href="http://ruleml.org/">RuleML</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)</a> &#8212; which has a rule such as <em>If someone is an attorney for a client then that client has a privileged relationship with the attorney</em>, it might follow from this rule that the attorney could not divulge the client&#8217;s secrets.  Applying such a rule to our sample, we could infer that Jane Smith cannot divulge Harris Hill&#8217;s secrets.</p>
<p><img src="http://morris108.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/tower-of-babel.jpg?w=300" alt="Tower of Babel" align="left" />Though it may seem here like too much technology for such a small and obvious task, it is essential where we scale up our queries and inferences on <a href="http://j.mp/925The">large corpora of legal texts</a> &#8212; hundreds of thousands if not millions of documents &#8212; which comprise vast storehouses of unstructured, yet meaningful data. Were all legal cases uniformly annotated, we could, in principle, find out every attorney for every plaintiff for every legal case.  Where our tagging structure is very rich, our queries and inferences could also be very rich and detailed.  Perhaps a more familiar way to view documents annotated with XML is as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">a database</a> to which further processes can be applied over the Web.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></p>
<p>As we have presented it, we have an input, the corpus of texts, and an output, texts annotated with XML tags.  The objective is to support a range of processes such as querying and inference.  However, getting from a corpus of textual information to annotated output is a demanding task, generically referred to as the <em><a href="http://j.mp/cvq5Ew">knowledge acquisition bottleneck</a></em>.  Not only is the task demanding on resources (time, money, manpower); it is also highly knowledge intensive since whoever is doing the annotation must know what to look for, and it is important that all of the annotators annotate the text in the same way (inter-annotator agreement) to support the processes.  Thus, automation is central.</p>
<p>Yet processing language to support such richly annotated documents confronts a spectrum of difficult issues.  Among them, natural language supports (1) implicit or presupposed information, (2) multiple forms with the same meaning, (3) the same form with different contextually dependent meanings, and (4) dispersed meanings. (Similar points can be made for sentences or other linguistic elements.) Here are examples of these four issues:</p>
<p>(1) &#8220;When did you stop taking drugs?&#8221; (presupposes that the person being questioned took drugs at sometime in the past);<br />
(2) Jane Smith, Jane R. Smith, Smith, Attorney Smith&#8230; (different ways to refer to the same person);<br />
(3) The individual referred to by the name &#8220;Jane Smith&#8221; in one case decision may not be the individual referred to by the name &#8220;Jane Smith&#8221; in another case decision;<br />
(4) Jane Smith represented Jones Inc. She works for Dewey, Cheetum, and Howe. To contact her, write to j.smith@dch.com .</p>
<p>When we search for information, a range of linguistic structures or relationships may be relevant to our query, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>grammatical constructions (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_voice">passive</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_voice">active</a> sentence forms, quotation, reference to other individuals, and so on),</li>
<li>grammatical relations among terms (e.g., whether an individual is the agent or target of some action),</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)#Ontology_components">ontological relations</a> (e.g., classes and subclasses of experts, or <a href="http://facstaff.uww.edu/reidl/American_Courts_System_Diagram.htm">the relationships among courts in the judicial hierarchy</a>),</li>
<li>relationships among elements (e.g., who works for what organization), or</li>
<li>high-level patterns such as <a href="http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol5-3/editorial.asp">legal arguments</a> (e.g., <a href="http://www.dougwalton.ca/papers%20in%20pdf/07ProbRiskpdf.pdf">expert testimony</a>) and fact patterns (e.g., <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2901.22">culpable intent</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>People grasp relationships between words and phrases, such that <em>Bill exercises daily</em> contrasts with the meaning of <em>Bill is a couch potato</em>, or that if it is true that <em>Bill used a knife to kill Phil</em>, then <em>Bill killed Phil</em>.  Finally, meaning tends to be sparse; that is, there are a few words and patterns that occur very regularly, while most words or patterns occur relatively rarely in the corpus.</p>
<p><a href="http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/index.html">Natural language processing (NLP)</a> takes on this highly complex and daunting problem as an <em>engineering</em> problem, decomposing large problems into smaller problems and subdomains until it gets to those which it can begin to address. Having found a solution to smaller problems, NLP can then address other problems or larger scope problems.  Some of the subtopics in NLP are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generation – converting information in a database into natural language.</li>
<li>Understanding – converting natural language into a machine-readable form.</li>
<li>Information Retrieval – gathering documents which contain key words or phrases. This is essentially what is done by Google.</li>
<li>Text Summarization – summarizing (in a paragraph) the main meaning of a text or corpus.</li>
<li>Question Answering – making queries and giving answers to them, in natural language, with respect to some corpus of texts.</li>
<li>Information Extraction &#8212; identifying, annotating, and extracting information from documents for reuse, representation, or reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we are primarily (here) interested in information extraction.</p>
<p><strong>NLP Approaches: Knowledge Light v. Knowledge Heavy </strong></p>
<p>There are a range of techniques that one can apply to analyse the linguistic data obtained from legal texts; each of these techniques has strengths and weaknesses with respect to different problems.  Statistical and machine-learning techniques are considered &#8220;knowledge light.&#8221;  With statistical approaches, the processing presumes very little knowledge by the system (or analyst). Rather, algorithms are applied that compare and contrast large bodies of textual data, and identify regularities and similarities.  Such algorithms encounter problems with sparse data or patterns that are widely dispersed across the text. (See <a href="http://www.jair.org/media/2934/live-2934-4846-jair.pdf">Turney and Pantel (2010)</a> for an overview of this area.)  Machine learning approaches apply learning algorithms to annotated material to extend results to unannotated material, thus introducing more knowledge into the processing pipeline.  However, the results are somewhat of a <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black box</a></em> in that we cannot really know the rules that are learned and use them further.  </p>
<p>With a &#8220;knowledge-heavy&#8221; approach, we <em>know</em>, in a sense, what we are looking for, and make this knowledge explicit in lists and rules for processing.  Yet, this is labour- and knowledge-intensive.  In the legal domain it is crucial to have humanly understandable explanations and justifications for the analysis of a text, which to our thinking warrants a knowledge-heavy approach.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">open source</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining">text-mining</a> package, <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE)</a>, consists of multiple components in a <em>cascade</em> or <em>pipeline</em>, each component automatically processing some aspect of the text, and then feeding into the next process.  The underlying strategy in all the components is to find a pattern (from either a list or a previous process) which matches a rule, and then to apply the rule which annotates the text.  Each component performs a particular process on the text, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentence segmentation – dividing text into sentences.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token">Tokenisation</a> - words identified by spaces between them.</li>
<li>Part-of-speech tagging – noun, verb, adjective, etc., determined by look-up and relationships among words.</li>
<li>Shallow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntactic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse">parsing</a>/chunking - dividing the text by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase">noun phrase</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase">verb phrase</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subordinate_clause">subordinate clause</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Named entity recognition – the entities in the text such as organisations, people, and places.</li>
<li>Dependency analysis - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subordinate_clause">subordinate clauses</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(linguistics)#Anaphor_resolution">pronominal anaphora</a> [i.e., identifying what a pronoun refers to], etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system can also be used to annotate more specifically to elements of interest.  In one <a href="http://wyner.info/LanguageLogicLawSoftware/index.php/2010/01/21/information-extraction-of-legal-case-features-with-lists-and-rules/">study</a>, we annotated legal cases from a case base (a corpus of cases) in order to identify a range of particular pieces of information that would be relevant to legal professionals such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case citation.</li>
<li>Names of parties.</li>
<li>Roles of parties, meaning plaintiff or defendant.</li>
<li>Type of court.</li>
<li>Names of judges.</li>
<li>Names of attorneys.</li>
<li>Roles of attorneys, meaning the side they represent.</li>
<li>Final decision.</li>
<li>Cases cited.</li>
<li>Nature of the case, meaning using keywords to classify the case in terms of subject (e.g., criminal assault, intellectual property, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying our lists and rules to a corpus of legal cases, a sample output is as follows, where the coloured highlights are annotated as per the key on the right; the colours are a visualisation of the sorts of tags discussed above (to see a larger version of the image, right click on the image, then click on &#8220;View Image&#8221; or a similar phrase; when finished viewing the image, use the browser&#8217;s back button to return to the text):</p>
<p><img src="http://wyner.info/research/L3S/Graphics/CalCrimAnnot01.png" alt="Annotation of a Criminal Case" /></p>
<p>The approach is very flexible and appears in similar systems. (See, for  example, de Maat and Winkels, <a href="http://j.mp/aDNF3Q">Automatic Classification of Sentences in Dutch Laws</a> (2008).)  While it is labour intensive to develop and maintain such list and rule systems, with a collaborative, Web-based approach, it may be feasible to construct rich systems to annotate large domains.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In this post, we have given a very brief overview of how <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/FAQ">the Semantic Web</a> and <a href="http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/index.html">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a> apply to legal textual information to support <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202432106864">annotation</a> which then enables <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/glossary.html#Q">querying</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference#Automatic_logical_inference">inference</a>.  Of course, this is but one take on a much larger domain.  In our view, it holds great promise in making legal information more transparent and available to more legal professionals.  Aside from <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">GATE</a>, some other resources on text analytics and NLP are textbooks and lecture notes (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00194ED1V01Y200905HLT003">Wilcock</a>), as well as  workshops (such as <a href="http://wyner.info/LanguageLogicLawSoftware/index.php/2010/04/21/semantic-processing-of-legal-texts-workshop/">SPLeT</a> and <a href="http://www.ittig.cnr.it/loait/loait10.html">LOAIT</a>).  While applications of Natural Language Processing to legal materials are largely <em>lab</em> studies, the use of NLP in conjunction with Semantic Web technology to annotate legal texts is a fast-developing, results-oriented area which targets meaningful applications for legal professionals.  It is well worth watching.</p>
