                                Hello, does anybody know of any tutorials/resources that discuss integrating Amazon&#039;s Mechanical Turk and Rails? (besides those resources that Amazon already provides)

Thanks!
 RTurk is incomplete, but looks promising.
 I&#039;ve updated RTurk and continued development, it should work for most jobs. Here&#039;s a little tutorial I wrote up on it - http://squarepush.com/ps/2009/08/11/mechanical-turk-in-ruby/

I&#039;ll be doing a more rails specific one in the next few days.

 HitBuilder can serve as a proxy to Mechanical Turk.
 There&#039;s always Rentacoder (albeit for requesting development related tasks)

Payment Help Mturk in World!
 
  Give Microworkers a try, it is a
  popular alternative to mturk -
  http://microworkers.com/?Id=e8d4a29f

 http://cloudcrowd.com is a great alternative to mechanical turk.  They accept work from anywhere in the world, and they help you design your workflow for optimal results.
 There&#039;s a round up of the main crowdsourcing companies here

http://thequill.org/personal-finance/9-making-money-on-line-part-2-microworking-.html
 it is not a duplicate because i am asking for alternatives, not a workaround to use mTurk. Humour me. Why the downvote? Should be called rent-a-slave. ...

                                I looked around but did not see anyone using Mechanical Turk for this.  I&#039;ve heard of the service, but never used it before.  I need to take the following graph and digitize it so I get a list of data points for each line (noting that there are two Y-axes, and thus depends on which line we are talking about).  This is pretty time consuming for me, and I saw other posts on StackOverflow about digitizing software doing a poor job at this.  Would Mechanical Turk be well suited to my task?

Here is the graph for reference:  http://www.yourpicturehost.com/dyno_hbspeed.jpg
 Depends how many of these you have. Mechanical turk could work quite well, but you&#039;d have to check the accuracy carefully (eg by re-plotting the graphs, and comparing them yourself).

If you have a lot, though - you should be able to design an image processing algorithm to pick up the data.

 I haven&#039;t done anything with it yet but I&#039;ve been meaning to use it for music search by having an app that accepted recordings of people humming or singing a tune and then using the Turk to identify the tune.
 It was used to help search for James Gray when he went missing.
 We&#039;ve used it to approve images that apply to a business. Not terribly interesting, but found it pretty useful in this regard. The tasks were completed very quickly.
 There are two works by Aaron Koblin that spring to mind: 


The Sheep Market - Workers were paid to draw pictures of sheep facing left.
Ten Thousand Cents - Workers were paid to copy a tiny fraction of a larger image.

 Halosys: We used Mechanical Turk for some of the customer projects we developed.

                                Due to wide spread popularity of stackoverflow.com among programmers, now a day one can find 
list of features that programmer would like to see on stackoverflow.
Some are genuine and some are jokes.

One such joke i found which says


  Stackoverflow.com will introduce a new
  software testing service inspired by
  Amazon&#039;s Mechanical Turk, where
  developers upload their programs and
  testers find bugs in exchange for a
  micropayment. Somebody then does the
  obvious and connects it to a
  Mechanical Turk task that gets one
  bunch of monkeys to write code and
  uses the second bunch to test it. A
  reasonably good clone of Windows 7 is
  banged out over 8 months with a budget
  of about $4,000


I would be interesting to know your feature.

 You can also use Amazon&#039;s Mechanical Turk to get testers.
 try http://beta-tester.co.uk/iphone
 You should write a blog post about your app and post the article to news.ycombinator.com.

A bunch of people will be interested in testing.

According to the API docs, it&#039;s not possible to create new HTML and add it...from the API. However, what I want to do here is use a HIT template I already created. It would seem like there should be a way to use that template (and load up new data in the API), since Amazon already approved it and I&#039;m using it for HITs already. But I haven&#039;t seen a way in the documentation to do so.



The main reason I want the HTML is so I can apply styles that I can&#039;t apply by using a questions file. If there was some sort of &#034;rich&#034; question file, that might solve the problem.

User pays for item and then returns to feedbackarmy.com with a link to results.


Essentially I would like to build a form that the user pays before submission to amazons mechanical turk community.

I know they have an api but not sure how to attempt to do this in the easiest way possible. I am an interaction designer, with not that strong of coding skills. More front end design.

I need to buy item from Amazon.com programatticaly without redirect to amazon web site for money withdraw? 

Thanks
 What I get from your question is you need Amazon as an underlying service for your applciation.

Have a look at


Amazon WebServices Api


and particularly this


Checkout by Amazon
What Your Customers See
Amazon Simple Pay


Hope this helps
 Your question is a little bit unclear, but I take it to mean that you would like to use Amazon Flexible Payment Service to complete a payment transaction without having the person who is paying sign in to their Amazon account and approve the payment. Yes?

You can&#039;t.

It is an intentional security measure. It prevents you from defrauding somebody.
 Good luck! ` ` ` ` I dearly hope that this is not possible. What if he works for a while first in Amazon Mechanical Turk? It&#039;s not possible. Nope, not even The Turk can do this. Yes, i ...

                                How will you test an iPhone application without the iPhone being available?
 The SDK comes with a simulator.
 Of course the simulator doesn&#039;t really provide true feedback and it is most advised to do most of the testing on a real iPhone or an iPod if you don&#039;t own one, you could possibly use some beta testing program and publish your app there, using ad-hoc provisioning and adding UDID&#039;s according to requests. You could try &#034;Mechanical Turk&#034;.
 &#039;True feedback&#039;?  About the only thing it doesn&#039;t simulate is multi-touch events.  Other than that, I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty damn good.  I developed an 8000 line app on the simulator, and when I got my dev cert for the device, it worked pretty much without modification.. ...

Here i want to get contactus or aboutus page url (example http://www.google.com/contact)  for each url which is present in csv file i have one idea checking the links with the following patterns (contact us, about us, about, locations).

If you do not find any of those, flag the url and write it into a log file. If you find the pattern, just print the address (it is used for some other process) 

Any one help how to do this 

Thanks in Advance
 use scrapy.
 I&#039;d suggest using Beautiful Soup to parse the page.  Another alternative would be to setup a HIT on Mechanical Turk.

Step 2) ? 

Step 3) Profit! (i.e., application opens raster image, vector file describing masks, does interesting stuff to areas of interest based on runtime context)

My question is &#039;what do we use for steps 1 and 2?&#039;

Primary goal is to reduce the time required to complete Steps 1 and 2 (the &#039;mechanical Turk&#039; part of the process). Strictly secondary goal is the ease of parsing / using the vector format describing the areas of interest / masks in step 3.

                                I&#039;ve got client that would like to capture data from a handwritten form. 

I have no idea how to implement this or what the cost would be. First, is this feasable/reasonable/affordable for a smallish size client. Second, how does intelligent character recognition work. (Do I need a ICR device? In what form does the data get extracted? How reliable is it?)

I did google this stuff, but more interested in first-hand experiences if any.
 I haven&#039;t done character recognition specifically, but I would start by applying some basic edge detection to the image.  You should be able to use an edge list for each character in the image to match it to a character.
 Well if you could get it to work properly, I guess you would be rich

I noticed it under the splash screen for livescribe, who&#039;s recognition is great.

                                Amazon Mechanical Turk is a mass-micro outsourcing API, where you can get lots&#039;s of small simple tasks (e.g.&#034;Is there a shop in this image&#034;) done relatively cheaply (e.g. 0.10 U$ per image).

Amazon seems to assume that this service is mostly of interest to US companies. This results in difficulties if you want to use the service (as an &#034;Requester&#034;): for example there is no easy way of funding your Account without an US Bank account.

Can somebody share experiences of using the Service from outside the US?
 The problem you have is that to actually be able to add funds to your account, you need to have a US billing address. If you can get round that issue, then it all works fine.
 Since Amazon doesn&#039;t let outside US access yet, you&#039;ll need to either:


Wait for Amazon to open it up to outside US, might be a long wait.

                                Akismet does an amazing job at detecting spam comments. But comments are not the only form of spam these days. What if I wanted something like akismet to automatically detect porn images on a social networking site which allows users to upload their pics, avatars, etc?

There are already a few image based search engines as well as face recognition stuff available so I am assuming it wouldn&#039;t be rocket science and it could be done. However, I have no clue regarding how that stuff works and how I should go about it if I want to develop it from scratch.

How should I get started?

Is there any open source project for this going on?
 short answer: use a moderator ;)

Long answer: I dont think there&#039;s a project for this cause what is porn? Only legs, full nudity, midgets etc. Its subjective.
 I would rather allow users report on bad images. Image ...

                                Hi, I&#039;m having hard time with tables and column widths.

Update: I&#039;m using XHTML Strict 1.0.

The page is: http://www.pro-turk.net/try

The first problem I have is, I have a column with a fixed width of 100px and 4px padding, but it disobeys my padding depending on the value. The column width (as the distance between two borders according to W3C Box Model) is 156 px even if padding is 0 or 4. Only the position of the text changes.

According to W3C Box Model ( available at www.pro-turk.net/box_model.png ), borders and paddings aren&#039;t included in WIDTH attribute, so why does it render wrongly ?

The second problem is, when you look the page I gave with IE8, the first cell in the second row has 150px fixed width, but ie shows it about 50% of the total table width regardless of what i say.
 You&#039;re using the default auto table-layout mode. That lets the browser ...

You can use a range like so:

In AS3:

myTextInput.restrict = &#039;0-9&#039;; 

In Flex:

&lt;mx:TextInput id=&#034;myTextInput&#034; restrict=&#034;0-9&#034; /&gt;

I haven&#039;t tested this, but it should work just fine, according to the docs.

I&#039;ve read various articles recommending / disparaging it&#039;s use, but I haven&#039;t ran across any real numbers practically demonstrating either sides arguments.

EDIT

I know that restrict is not officially part of C++, but it is supported by some compilers and I&#039;ve read a paper by Christer Ericson which strongly recommends it&#039;s usage.
 I tested this C-Program. Without restrict it took 12.640 seconds to complete, with restrict 12.516. Looks like it can save some time.
 Note that C++ compilers that allow the restrict keyword may still ignore it.  That is the case for example here.
 The restrict keyword does a difference. 

I&#039;ve seen improvements of factor 2 and more in some situations (image processing). Most ...

in regular expression validator the below expression works but i need in restrict field.

&amp;lt;mx:TextInput id=&#034;txtTop&#034;  restrict=&#034;[0-9+-][0-9]*$&#034; /&amp;gt;


Valid values are

+023

23

0

invalid

+-123

-+2132

Thanks in advance
 Change the value of restrict based on the length of the string.

&amp;lt;mx:TextInput id=&#034;ti&#034; restrict=&#034;[0-9+\-]&#034; change=&#034;onChange(event)&#034;/&amp;gt;

private function onChange(event:Event):void
{
    if(ti.text.length &amp;gt; 0)
        ti.restrict = &#034;[0-9]&#034;;
    else
        ti.restrict = &#034;[0-9+\-]&#034;

Outlook.Items filteredItems = inbox.Items.Restrict(sCriteria);


This version doesn&#039;t work, doesn&#039;t find any mail:

 The property you are looking for is:

inbox.Items.Restrict(&#034;[SenderEmailAddress]=&#039;mymail@mydomain.com&#039;&#034;);

                                What are best tools available for Data Capturing from Scanned Images? Doesn&#039;t matter they are free or paid. They should be able to convert scanned images to data (text, image, tables etc.). Most importantly they should have API to integrate with .NET 2.0 for automation.


Edit: The input data will generally be Text, Images, Tables places in the image. These images will basically be scanned pages from Catalogs containing data.

 You mean OCR (Optical Character Recognition)?
 Here are some example products:

Ocrtools

All these SourceForge .NET OCR&#039;s
 I recommend that you take a look into ReadIris Pro, which claims to have Automated Document Processing. There&#039;s a good chance that it has some form of API, although I have not actually verified that.

I do know that it is happy with text, tables, and handprinting (handwriting in all caps), and as an added bonus can recognise barcodes.

It does cost, though, but it not prohibitively expensive.

                                Try setting the padding of &lt;td&gt; to more than 1px, you can&#039;t.

You can only specify 0 or 1px padding for this td. But why ? It&#039;s same in both transitional and strict document types.

http://www.pro-turk.net/xhtml_col.html
 It is probably that you are not defining the unit for the padding. setting it something like 10px (in chrome at least) works fine.
 Maybe because you&#039;re specifying the padding as 1 - no units - rather than 1px, 1em, etc.

It&#039;s fine to specify 0 without units, as 0 is the same in any unit - but not 1.
 Thanks for the answer :)
