Called Microsoft Advertising, the software giant is out to advertise to the masses. Redmond's new marketing division differs from Google AdWords in execution. Instead of being one solid service, Microsoft Advertising is actually an amalgamation of several services purchased over the years, such as Atlas and Massive. Despite the intense competition, the computing giant remains confident that they will be able to compete with the search engine king. We here at the Free Line wish Microsoft the best of luck. Having another place to advertise is never bad thing. http Have you ever thought it would be cool if you could combine the social networking powerhouse Facebook and download king BitTorrent? Now you can, thanks to Morrent. Morrent works hand in hand with popular client uTorrent, allowing users to monitor and control their downloads from their Facebook profiles. Think of it as a high-tech way to stalk your torrents when you're away from your system.

<div style="height:100px; overflow:hidden; font-size:10px;">www.globalchange.com Emotion is more important than technology, gadgets, gizmos or inventions. Emotion is what will drive the future because it dictates how people feel and how they live. That's why market research is unreliable when it comes to future predictions - because people don't know how they will feel in future in response - say - to a terror attack or some new techno advance they never anticipated.

Leadership purpose, aims, strategy and objectives. Profits and profitability. Motivation to succeed and secrets of business success. Productivity and efficiency key. Workplace morale. Team dynamics and leadership styles. Business mission and vision. Business values and office culture. Motivation at work. People don't get passionate about shareholder value or profits or excel spreadsheets.

<div style="height:100px; overflow:hidden; font-size:10px;">Enerway met Fredrik L�fvendahl the Sales and Marketing Manager at Rejlers Energitj�nster AB, in Copenhagen during the Smart Metering Conference. Rejlers Energitj�nster is a service provider and they are operating on the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish market. Rejlers provides a lot of services, for example they collect metering values, perform Balance settlements and provide web portals where end customers can follow their consumption. One of the services that they provide is helping end customers to reduce the consumption costs by installing Smart Meters that collects meter values more frequently than conventional meters. In Sweden most meters used to be read once a year, today they are read once a month or once an hour. What is Smart Metering from Rejlers point of view? For Rejlers, Smart meters give them the chance to make better analysis. For example in the Balance settlement where they can achieve improved calculations in the net, become aware of disturbances and make sure that the net is doing ok. Its important for Rejlers to attend at the Smart Metering Conference for the reason that it gives them a chance to follow the movements in the energy business. Interesting areas are for example Smart Metering, Smart Grid and Smart Living. They believe that Smart Living will become an interesting business for the future where meters, grids and peoples homes will be integrated and working together.
