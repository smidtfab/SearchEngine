    <p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-33457" src="http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-153.png" alt="" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="251" align="right" />CloudCrowd is an on-demand  labor-as-a-service crowdsourcing company that uses a Facebook  application to route work to laborers. It takes a complex  project that a company would normally have to hire and train employees  to do and breaks it down into thousands of short, simple tasks which are  performed and verified by laborers.</p>
<p>By running its system on  Facebook, it has access to plenty of labor from around the world, and  are present where these people spend their time online. CloudCrowd’s  biggest challenge is convincing companies that crowdsourcing will work  for their projects to fill its Facebook app’s available work queue.</p>
<p>CloudCrowd was founded  in 2009 by Jordan Ritter, the co-founder of Napster and crowdsourced  spam-fighting company Cloudmark, and former Cloudmark executive Alex  Edelstein. The San Francisco-based team has 15 employees, half of whom are engineers, and is self-funded. It has a pool of over 25,000  registered labor-on-demand workers including work at home moms, retired  professionals, and college students, and 1.5 million tasks have been  completed on the system.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33460" src="http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-1541-500x282.png" alt="" width="500" height="282" /></p>
<p>Depending on the size and complexity, clients  pay $5,000 to hundreds of thousands per project plus a $5,000 set up  fee, but only pay for completed, approved work. Current clients range  from start ups to Fortune 500 companies in industries like e-commerce,  education, web search, social networking, business data, and content  publication. They include start up RentCycle, Lombardi Sports, and the  University of Southern California, which used CloudCrowd to find  potential donors by having laborers pull alumni names and locations from  thousands of old documents.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was the first full  scale modern crowdsourcing marketplace, but those with projects to complete had  to write instructions and verify accuracy of work for each task, making  it hard to scale. <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2010/07/23/crowdflower-api-trialpay/">CrowdFlower improved this process</a> by creating a system  that verified work by comparing the output of multiple workers on  Mechanical Turk and other worker pools. CloudCrowd seeks to further  streamline the process by eliminating redundancy through peer reviews  that verify work, and by creating what it calls a labor operating system  that uses APIs to turn a client’s labor need into a function call.</p>
<h3>From Complex Project  to Completed Work</h3>
<p>To  initiate a project, a CloudCrowd project manager meets with a client to  determine how a complex, multi-part task can be reframed as a series of  small, simple tasks. CloudCrowd has developed streamlined “machines”  for many common building blocks of complex tasks. These machines are  actually sets of instructions and tools that when given to their  laborers, help them quickly and accurately complete tasks like  translation, copy editing, data reformatting, and data mining from web  search. CloudCrowd restructures a client’s project to be done by these  machines, and builds new ones when necessary, enlarging its repertoire  of machines over time.</p>
<p>This process removes a large inefficiency of  crowdsourcing to date — that clients had to write instructions  themselves, a tricky process that Crowdcloud’s in-house employees are  trained in. A batch of tasks is run as a trial to ensure the  instructions and tools are accurate, and once approved by the client,  it’s only a mater of funneling data in and out of the machines to  generate a completed project.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33456" src="http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-1421-300x500.png" alt="" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="300" height="500" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tasks are assigned a payment value, from a  cent for simple tasks that take a few seconds like creating directory  entries for websites, to dollars for longer, more complex task like  editing documents. They are then routed to laborers by listing them as  available work on CloudCrowd’s Facebook application. Consistent,  accurate work builds a worker’s credibility score slowly over time,  while inaccurate work quickly decreases their score. As a worker  completes tasks, money is added to their CloudCrowd account, which is  then paid out to a PayPal account the next day.</p>
<p>Difficult tasks are  only open to those with high credibility scores, and certain specialized  tasks like translation requires the worker to pass proficiency tests to  earn credentials. CloudCrowd differs from other crowdsourcing  companies, though, because quality assurance of work is based on  credible peer review, instead of comparing the output of multiple  workers performing the same task.</p>
<p>First a worker completes a task, then a  worker with a higher credibility rating than the first verifies the  accuracy of the work as a short task of its own. This continues up the  credibility ladder as necessary, and once someone with a high enough  rating verifies the work, CloudCrowd can be confident it is accurate  without having multiple workers repeat the longer root of the task. This  creates a highly efficient system that can verify all types of tasks,  not just those verifiable by two people having identical answers.</p>
<p>To kickstart the  system as the best workers built their credibility ratings, CloudCrowd  employees initially acted as the final say on accuracy. Soon, the worker  community had some highly credible laborers and could handle  verification autonomously. This leaves the company’s employees to focus  on writing instructions, building tools, reassembling projects, and  finding clients.</p>
<h3>Facebook as a Gateway to Labor</h3>
<p>CloudCrowd launched  its Facebook app in October of last year, and was immediately besieged  by people wanting to join its labor pool. Workers quickly outpaced the  supply of tasks, and the company had to turn off viral features like  posting to users’ feed when they earned money. Potential workers could  still sign up if they found their way to the application, or if they  were invited through CloudCrowd’s referral program called Personal  Crowd, where users get paid a percentage for the work done by those who  sign up with their referral code.</p>
<p>When a user opens the CloudCrowd app,  they see their summary page which lists their earnings, credibility  score, and work history, showing the tasks they’ve attempted and how  their performance on each was graded. The appeals section lets users  contest erroneous evaluations, and My Details lets users manage their  credentials earned from passing proficiency tests and the PayPal account  to which their earnings are paid.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33454" src="http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-145-500x421.png" alt="" width="500" height="421" /></p>
<p>The Available Work tab lists all the  open tasks on CloudCrowd. Tasks have project names, categories,  credential and credibility score requirements and today’s pay rate for  completion. For instance, a user might see a project named “Review  Business Categorizations”, which falls under the “Categorize, Tag and  Label” machine, requires a credibility score of 31 and pays $.02 per  task completed.</p>
<p>Clicking  the task leads to the instructions page explaining how the task is  performed, the criteria for a task being verified as complete, and  special notes to help workers avoid common pitfalls. In this case, a user  must visit links and determine if a company is a retailer,  manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor. As the sites are categorized,  higher credibility users are given tasks in which they check to see that  the categorizations are accurate. Since users are paid by the task, not  by time, they can complete as many or as few tasks as they like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33453" src="http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-148-500x215.png" alt="" width="500" height="215" /></p>
<p>The only real issue  with the Facebook app is that there often aren’t any tasks available that  don’t require translation credentials. As companies are still  acclimating to crowdsourcing their work, and CloudCrowd has an ample  worker pool, the general tasks available during peak hours are quickly  completed. To solve this, CloudCrowd lets users sign up for email  notifications telling them when work becomes available. If the company sees there  are not enough people with credentials to perform a specific task, like  German to English translation, it simply raises the pay rate and watches  as users send invitations to those with the right skills in hopes of  getting a cut of the money.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33452" src="http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-150-500x153.png" alt="" width="500" height="153" /></p>
<p>The application is simple, but effective.  Instructions are clear, and any questions can often be cleared up in  each task’s dedicated forum. Since CloudCrowd is on Facebook, it makes  it easy to pop in and complete a few tasks while chatting or waiting for  your energy to replenish in a social game. The work history makes  grading transparent, and payments happen promptly. Once CloudCrowd gets  more clients signed up and fills up the available work queue, it could be  a reliable way to earn money for users with a few minutes or a few  hours, specialized skill sets or no training.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>CloudCrowd becomes  more efficient with each project it undertakes. Developing more machines  and improving instructions, it is able to easily complete more complex  tasks for cheaper. Its improvement on the translation process is a good  example of how it is disrupting industries. Previously, a company would  farm out translation to specialists who worked full time, translating by  the full page and requiring separate editing. Projects would cost $80 a  page and take three days says CTO Jordan Ritter. With CloudCrowd  translating line by line for a few cents each, it can complete the same  project in one day for $10, and charge $20, a quarter of the cost of  traditional translation companies.</p>
<p>Its efficiency on translation and  editing tasks has led them to spin off dedicated companies in these  verticals called TranslationZen and EditZen. Clients are only concerned  with price, speed and accuracy, and don’t mind CloudCrowd using  crowdsourcing to accomplish tasks. Ritter says the company will continue  to expand into new verticals.</p>
<p>The Facebook application operates as an  iframe instead of outside of Facebook using connect because this keeps  the burden of session verification on Facebook. However, Facebook often  makes changes to the iframe, which CloudCrowd has to scramble to adopt.  The company is it would like to see Facebook relax restrictions on what  can be done inside the iframes to provide a richer, more efficient  interface for completing certain tasks.</p>
<p>CloudCrowd are now  improving its APIs, hoping to systemize common tasks for clients such  that they can simply enter the foreign language text and make the  function call get_translate to get an accurate English translation  quickly and cheaply. The biggest challenge now is for CloudCrowd’s  business development team to convince companies to break away from the  traditional route of of hiring employees or commissioning specialists to  complete projects and view crowdsourcing as an option even for highly  complex tasks. If it could fill its Facebook app’s task queue, the  company could use its adequate labor pool who handle quality assurance  themselves to make assigning tasks to CloudCrowd the new outsourcing.</p>
