One of the most popular tasks is answering surveys. However, without adequate controls, researchers should be concerned that respondents may fill out surveys haphazardly in the unsupervised environment of the Internet. Social scientists refer to mental shortcuts that people take as satisficing and this concept has been applied to how respondents take surveys. We examine the prevalence of survey satisficing on MTurk. We present a questionpresentation method, called Kapcha, which we believe reduces satisficing, thereby improving the quality of survey results. We also present an open-source platform for further survey experimentation on MTurk.","keywords":["crowdsourcing","instructions","manipulation checks","mechanical turk","online sur","satisficing","screening","survey design","veys"],"stats":{"academic_status":{"10":2,"7":1,"5":3},"readers":6,"discipline":{"98":1,"303":1,"140":1,"101":3},"country":{"United States":2,"Ireland":1,"Germany":1,"United Kingdom":1,"India":1}},"pages":"1-10","public_file_hash":"db46ccaeedcab59e40e61cf50e72b6b4d5b8dcdd","published_in":"Information Systems Journal","type":"conference_proceedings","url":"preventing-satisficing-online-surveys-kapcha-ensure-higher-quality-data","id":"b6fd0970-ece0-11df-9bff-0024e8453de6","authors":[{"forename":"Adam","surname":"Kapelner"},{"forename":"Dana","surname":"Chandler"}],"fingerprint":619270270638156288,"title":"Preventing Satisficing in Online Surveys : A \u201c Kapcha \u201d to Ensure Higher Quality Data","mendeley_authors":{"3709908162":876311},"year":2010,"categories":[101,98,140,303],"file_hash":"db46ccaeedcab59e40e61cf50e72b6b4d5b8dcdd","profile_ids":[35904,1201501,2028641,268862,876311,531961],"oa_journal":false,"fullUrl":"\/research\/preventing-satisficing-online-surveys-kapcha-ensure-higher-quality-data\/"});

ABSTRACT<br />
Researchers are increasingly using online labor markets such<br />
as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) as a source of inex-<br />
pensive data. One of the most popular tasks is answering<br />
surveys. However, without adequate controls, researchers<br />
should be concerned that respondents may fill out surveys<br />
haphazardly in the unsupervised environment of the Inter-<br />
net. Social scientists refer to mental shortcuts that people<br />
take as “satisficing” and this concept has been applied to<br />
how respondents take surveys. We examine the prevalence<br />
of survey satisficing on MTurk. We present a question-<br />
presentation method, called Kapcha, which we believe re-<br />
duces satisficing, thereby improving the quality of survey<br />
results. We also present an open-source platform for further<br />
survey experimentation on MTurk.<br />

It has been well established that survey-takers may “sat-<br />

amount of effort and attention they devote to filling out<br />

a survey [12].1 As a result, the quality of data in surveys<br />
may be lower than researchers’ expectations. Because sur-<br />
veys attempt to measure internal mental processes, they<br />
are by their very nature not easily verifiable by external<br />
sources. This presents a potential problem for the many re-<br />
searchers who are beginning to employ Amazon’s Mechani-<br />
cal Turk (MTurk) workers to answer surveys and participate<br />
in academic research[17, 10, 4]. Moreover, unlike other tasks<br />
completed on MTurk, inaccuracies in survey data cannot be<br />
remedied by having multiple workers complete a survey, nor<br />
is there an easy way to check them against “gold-standard”<br />
data.2<br />
In our experiment, we examine alternative ways to present<br />
survey questions in order to make respondents read and an-<br />
swer questions more carefully.<br />
Our first treatment “exhorts” participants to take our sur-<br />
vey seriously. We ask for their careful consideration of our<br />
questions by placing a message in prominent red text on the<br />
bottom of every question. Surprisingly, this has no effect.<br />
Our two other treatments took a more economic approach<br />
and attempted to alter the incentives of survey-takers who<br />
ordinarily have an incentive to fill out questions as quickly<br />
as possible in order to maximize their hourly wage and ex-<br />
ert minimal cognitive effort. More specifically, both treat-<br />
ments force the participant to see the question for a certain<br />
“waiting period”. Combined, these waiting period treat-<br />
ments improved the quality of survey responses by 10.0%<br />
(p &lt; 0.001). Under the waiting period treatments, the par-<br />
ticipant is forced to spend more time on each question and<br />
once there, we hypothesize that they will spend more time<br />
thinking about and thoughtfully answering questions.<br />
The first of these two treatments, called simply the Tim-<br />
ing control treatment, features a disabled continue button<br />
for the duration of the waiting period. The second of these<br />
treatments, referred to as the Kapcha3 has a waiting pe-<br />
riod equal to that of the Timing control treatment, but also<br />
attempts to attract the attention of respondents by sequen-<br />
1Jon Krosnick [12] applies Herbert Simon’s famous idea of<br />
satisficing [18] to how respondents complete surveys.<br />
2In an MTurk context, “gold-standard” data refers to asking<br />
workers questions to which the surveyor already knows the<br />
answer as a way to identify bad workers. Although this is<br />
straightforward for an image labeling task (e.g. [9] and [19]),<br />
it is less clear how to apply this concept to surveys.<br />
3The name was inspired from the “Captcha” Internet<br />
challenge-response test to ensure a human response [23].<br />

prompt, and its answer choices. This treatment was the<br />
most effective and improved quality by approximately 13%.<br />
To proxy for quality, which is largely unobservable, we in-<br />
troduce a “trick question” into the survey as a way of mea-<br />
suring whether people carefully read instructions. We echo<br />
the methodology from [16] who call this trick question an in-<br />
structional manipulation check (IMC). Additionally, we give<br />
respondents two hypothetical thought experiments where we<br />
ask them to imagine how they would behave under certain<br />
conditions. The conditions are identical except for a subtle<br />
word change that would only be apparent if the instructions<br />
were read carefully — hence, for close readers, there should<br />
be a greater difference in reported behavior as compared<br />
with people who were merely skimming.4<br />
This paper presents initial evidence on alternative ways<br />
to present survey questions in order to reduce satisficing.<br />
We hypothesize that altering the cost-benefit analysis un-<br />
dertaken by survey respondents is the mechanism which re-<br />
duces satisficing. The approach we present has the benefit<br />
of improving the quality of results without increasing mon-<br />
etary cost or convenience for the surveyor. We also examine<br />
the prevalence of satisficing and how it may vary across re-<br />
spondent demographics. Finally, we discuss ideas for further<br />
improving how to present survey questions.<br />
Section 2 explains our experimental methods. Section 3<br />
illustrates our most important results, section 4 concludes,<br />
and section 5 talks about future directions. Appendix A<br />
describes the TurkSurveyor open-source package for running<br />
experiments and appendix B provides links to our source<br />
code and data so that others may replicate and verify our<br />
results.<br />
2. METHODS<br />
2.1 Recruitment of Participants<br />
We designed an MTurk HIT (our “task”) to appear as a<br />
nondescript survey task similar to many others that are now<br />
popular on MTurk. By making our survey appear like any<br />
other, we intended to recruit a population that is represen-<br />
tative of the MTurk survey-taking population.<br />
We entitled our task “Take a short 30-question survey<br />
— $0.11USD” and its description was “Answer a few short<br />
questions for a survey”. The preview pane of the HIT only<br />
displayed, “Welcome to the short survey! In this survey<br />
you will answer 30 questions. You may only do one sur-<br />
vey.” Our HIT was labeled with the keywords “survey”,<br />
“questionnaire”, “survey, “poll”, “opinion”, “study”, and<br />
“experiment” so that people specifically looking for survey<br />
tasks could easily find our task. However, we also wanted<br />
to attract workers who were not specifically looking for sur-<br />
vey tasks. Therefore, we posted batches of tasks at various<br />
times.<br />
We recruited 784 MTurk workers from the United States.5<br />
4This portion of our experiment replicates Study 1 in [16].<br />
Their primary focus was to identify subsamples of higher<br />
quality data and to eliminate the “noisy data” (i.e., the par-<br />
ticipants who did not read the instructions carefully enough<br />
to pass the trick question). This enables researchers to in-<br />
crease the statistical power of their experiments.<br />
5This restriction reduces the influence of any confounding<br />
language-specific or cultural effects. Generalizing our results<br />
to other countries and languages may be a fruitful future<br />
Each worker was only allowed to complete one survey task<br />
and took one of four different versions of the survey accord-<br />
ing to their randomized assignment. In total, 727 workers<br />
completed the entire survey and each was paid $0.11USD.6<br />
We posted in batches of 200 tasks at a time four times per<br />
day (at 10AM, 4PM, 10PM, and 4AM EST) as to not bias<br />
for early-riser or night-owl workers. Altogether, 18 bunches<br />
(of 200 HITs each) were posted between September 1 and<br />
September 5, 2010. All HITs expired six hours after creation<br />
as to not interfere with the subsequent batch. Note that if<br />
we had posted our tasks as one gargantuan batch and waited<br />
until completion (possibly a week or longer), we would have<br />
attracted a majority of workers who were specifically looking<br />
for survey tasks (most likely searching for them via keyword)<br />
rather than a more general sample of workers.7 The workers<br />
were given a maximum of 45 minutes to complete the task.8<br />
2.2 Treatments<br />
To test the satisficing-reducing effect of the Kapcha, we<br />
randomized each participant into one of four treatments<br />
which are described below, summarized in table 1, and pic-<br />
tured in figures 1a–d.9<br />

Exhortation X<br />

Kapcha X X<br />
The first treatment was the Control where the questions<br />
were displayed in a similar fashion as any other online sur-<br />
vey.<br />
Our Exhortation treatment presents survey questions in<br />
an identical way as the Control treatment except that we<br />
try to increase the survey taker’s motivation by reminding<br />
them in alarming red text at the bottom of each question<br />
page to “Please answer accurately. Your responses will be<br />
used for research.” Past research on survey design has shown<br />
that respondents are more likely to devote effort to complet-<br />
research direction.<br />
6The workers worked 81.3 hours at an average wage of<br />
$0.98/hr and a total cash cost to the experimenters of $87.97<br />
(including Amazon’s fee of 10%). In this calculation, we ig-<br />
nore the time they spent on the feedback question and the<br />
bonuses we paid.<br />
7This phenomenon is due to HITs rapidly losing prominence<br />
in the public listings and eventually being relegated to ob-<br />
scurity where they may only be found by those searching via<br />
keyword (see [5]). Also note that we save the time each HIT<br />
was created at and expires at. We use this information to<br />
check at what point in the HIT listing life-cycle the worker<br />
accepted the HIT.<br />
8Even though the survey was short, we wanted to give ample<br />
time to be able to collect data on task breaks. Note that few<br />
workers took advantage of the long time limit; 117 workers<br />
(16%) took more than 15 minutes and only 61 workers (8%)<br />
took more than 30 minutes.<br />

                                                <div class="plaintext">ing surveys if they perceive them as valuable because they<br />
contribute to research [12].<br />
Rather than using exhortation, our Timing control and<br />
Kapcha treatments induce more careful survey taking by<br />
changing the incentives of a respondent. In short, we lower<br />
the payoff to satisficing.10 When respondents can breeze<br />
through a survey and click one answer after another with-<br />
out delay, they may be tempted to satisfice — i.e., click the<br />
first answer that seems correct or any answer at random. If,<br />
however, survey respondents are forced to wait before pro-<br />
ceeding to the next question, we hypothesize that they will<br />
use this time to think more carefully about how to answer.<br />
Our Timing control treatment is identical to the Control<br />
treatment except that the continue button is disabled and<br />
has a spinning graphic during a waiting period11 after which<br />
the continue button is enabled.<br />
The Kapcha treatment goes one step further and, in addi-<br />
tion to slowing down the respondent for a time equal to the<br />
Timing control treatment, also draws additional attention<br />
to the instructions and answer choices by “fading-in” the<br />
survey’s words at 250 words per minute.<br />
The delay time for the questions in the Timing control<br />
treatment were calibrated to be the same total fade-in time<br />
for the Kapcha participant’s question. By controlling for the<br />
timed delay, we were able to isolate the additional effect due<br />
to forcing the respondent to pay attention to the words in<br />
the Kapcha.<br />
Although this is the first research to our knowledge that<br />
studies waiting periods and textual fade-ins, there is a long<br />
history of research on how various forms of survey imple-<br />
mentation affect response. Two interesting examples include<br />
how self-administration lead respondents to answer sensitive<br />
questions more truthfully and how questions that are accom-<br />
panied by audio do the same among people who might not<br />
understand the text (especially among low-literacy respon-<br />
dents). Recently, [6] has helped separate the effect of the<br />
self-administration and the audio component.12<br />
2.3 Custom Survey Task Design<br />
As soon as the worker accepted the HIT, they were given a<br />
page with directions that explained the length of the survey<br />
and asked to begin when ready. Depending on the treat-<br />
ment, we also added an additional sentence or two to the<br />
instructions in order to explain the particularities associ-<br />
ated with each treatment. For our Exhortation group, we<br />
emphasized the importance of giving accurate and honest<br />
answers. In our Timing control group, we told participants<br />
that the continue button would be disabled for a short time<br />
so they would have more time to read and answer each ques-<br />
10If the Exhortation treatment increased the rate at which<br />
people passed the trick question (which it did not), we might<br />
have worried that this framing could bias the way survey<br />
takers answer questions, particularly socially sensitive ones,<br />
since it reminds the respondent that they are under scrutiny.<br />
In social psychology, over-reporting “positive” behaviors is<br />
known as the “social desirability bias” [7].<br />
11We peg the waiting period to the time it takes an average<br />
person to read the number of words in each question. [20]<br />
finds that the average reading speed for college-level readers<br />
is 280 words per minute and 250 for twelfth-graders. We<br />
chose 250 words per minute.<br />
12For an excellent, though slightly dated review of various<br />
survey presentation formats and the issues they try to over-<br />
come, see Chapter 10.1 of [22]<br />
tion. For our Kapcha group, we mentioned how words and<br />
answer choices would appear one at a time.<br />
After reading the directions, the worker began the sur-<br />
vey task which consisted of 30 questions plus two optional<br />
questions eliciting feedback. Each question was presented<br />
individually so that the respondent must click submit be-<br />
fore moving onto the next question.13<br />
Our first question, “question A”, is a hypothetical thought<br />
experiment (which we call the soda-pricing example) that<br />
“demonstrates how different expectations can change peo-<br />
ple’s willingness to pay for identical experiences” [16]. The<br />
question text is shown below. The subtle text manipula-<br />
tion which induces an effect according to [21] is shown in<br />
brackets and will be denoted as the “run-down” vs. “fancy”<br />
treatments:<br />
You are on the beach on a hot day. For<br />
the last hour you have been thinking about how<br />
much you would enjoy an ice cold can of soda.<br />
Your companion needs to make a phone call and<br />
offers to bring back a soda from the only nearby<br />
place where drinks are sold, which happens to be<br />
a [run-down grocery store / fancy resort]. Your<br />
companion asks how much you are willing to pay<br />
for the soda and will only buy it if it is below<br />
the price you state. How much are you willing to<br />
pay?<br />
It has been shown repeatedly in the literature that people<br />
are willing to pay more when the beverage comes from a<br />
fancy resort. If the workers were reading the instructions<br />
carefully, we expect them to pay a higher price in the “fancy”<br />
treatment.<br />
The worker was then given “question B,” another hy-<br />
pothetical thought experiment (which we call the football<br />
attendance example), which demonstrates that people are<br />
susceptible to the sunk cost fallacy (for screenshots, see fig-<br />
ure 1a–d). The question text is shown below. The subtle<br />
text manipulation which induces an effect according to [21]<br />
is shown in brackets and will be denoted as the “paid” vs<br />
“free” treatments:<br />
Imagine that your favorite football team is<br />
playing an important game. You have a ticket to<br />
the game that you have [paid handsomely for /<br />
received for free from a friend]. However, on the<br />
day of the game, it happens to be freezing cold.<br />
What do you do?<br />
Their intention was gauged on a nine-point scale where<br />
1 was labeled “definitely stay at home” and 9 was labeled<br />
“definitely go to the game”. It has been shown that people<br />
who read the treatment where they paid for the tickets are<br />
more likely to go to the game.<br />
By randomizing the text changes independently of treat-<br />
ments, we were able compare the strength of these two well-<br />
established psychological effects across the four types of survey-<br />
presentation.<br />
13Note that most surveys on MTurk display all questions on<br />
one page. Presenting questions one at a time, as we do in our<br />
study, probably serves to reduce satisficing. A future study<br />
would allow us to determine how the number of questions<br />
on each page affects satisficing.<br />

shown at 10 seconds since page load.<br />
The participant then answered an “instructional manip-<br />
ulation check” (IMC) question. Once again, this is a trick<br />
question designed to gauge whether the participant reads<br />
and follows directions carefully. The instructions of the IMC<br />
question asks the participant which sports they like to play<br />
and provides many options. However, within the question’s<br />
directions (i.e. the “fine print”), we tell the respondent to<br />
ignore the question prompt and instead click on the title<br />
above (see Fig 2). If the participant clicked the title, they<br />
“pass” the IMC; any other behavior is considered failure.<br />
We administer the IMC and consider it to be a proxy for<br />
satisficing behavior in general14 which we were able to com-<br />
pare across the four treatments.<br />
After this point, there are no longer any differences in<br />
how we present survey questions across the treatments. We<br />
turn off the Kapcha fade-in, the Timing control, and the<br />
Exhortation message. This allows us to collect demographics<br />
and need for cognition measures in a way that is comparable<br />
and independent of treatment.15<br />
The next eight questions collect demographic information.<br />
We ask for birth year, gender, and level of education. We<br />
then ask a few questions about their general work habits<br />
on MTurk: “Why do you complete tasks in Mechanical<br />
Turk?”, “How much do you earn per week on Mechanical<br />
Turk?”, “How much time do you spend per week on Me-<br />
14[16] could not detect a significant difference between the<br />
“fancy resort” and the “run-down grocery store” conditions<br />
in question A using the full sample, but could detect a sig-<br />
nificant difference using data only from the participants who<br />
passed the IMC. This is an intuitive result; the psychological<br />
effect that occurs due to subtle word changes would only be<br />
detectable if a respondent carefully read the instructions.<br />
15Naturally, the influence of the treatment from the first<br />
three questions may linger.<br />
chanical Turk?”16, and “Do you generally multi-task while<br />
doing HITs?” To see if people who take surveys more of-<br />
ten are any different, we also ask: “What percent of your<br />
time on MTurk do you spend answering surveys, polls, or<br />
questionnaires?”.<br />
After the eight demographic questions, we administer an<br />
18-question abbreviated version of the full “Need for Cog-<br />
nition” (NFC) scale (see [2]). Respondents say how charac-<br />
teristic each of the statements are of their personality (e.g.<br />
“I find satisfaction in deliberating hard and for long hours”)<br />
on a five-point scale where 1 indicates “extremely unchar-<br />
acteristic” and 5 indicates “extremely characteristic”.17 In<br />
short, the NFC scale assesses how much an individual has<br />
a need to think meticulously and abstractly. This is of in-<br />
terest to our study because an individual’s NFC may itself<br />
affect the probability of satisficing during a survey. People<br />
who have a higher NFC are also more likely to fill out the<br />
survey diligently and appear with high scores. Those with<br />
low NFC will have scores that are attenuated toward the<br />
center (i.e., 3) because they are more likely to haphazardly<br />
guess.<br />
For the 30th question, we ask the participant to rate how<br />
motivated they were to take this survey on a nine-point<br />
scale.<br />
We then give two optional feedback questions. On both<br />
questions, we indicated that responses would be given either<br />
a $0.01, $0.05 USD bonus, or no bonus (these three levels<br />
were randomized in order to test the effect of bonus level on<br />
feedback quality). The amount of feedback is also used as a<br />
16This question was used in [11], which presents result from<br />
a large MTurk survey<br />
17Approximately half of the questions are also reverse-coded<br />
so that noisy survey responses would cancel themselves out<br />
and tend toward the center.<br />

The first question inquired, “What did you like most about<br />
this survey? What did you like least about this survey?<br />
Is there anything you would recommend to make it bet-<br />
ter?” The second feedback prompt was only relevant for the<br />
Kapcha or Timing control treatments. We asked, “Certain<br />
respondents had to wait for each survey question to com-<br />
plete before filling in answers. We are especially interested<br />
in knowing how this affected the way you took the survey.”<br />
2.4 Other Data Collected<br />
During our recruitment period, we posted HIT bunches<br />
(see section 2.1 for details) with an equal number of tasks<br />
in each of the four experimental treatments.<br />
In addition to the participants’ responses, we recorded<br />
how long survey respondents spent on each part of the sur-<br />
vey. This gave us some indication of how seriously people<br />
took our survey (i.e., read instructions, considered answers<br />
to questions). We also recorded when the participant’s task<br />
window was focused on our task or focused on another win-<br />
dow.18<br />
In the future, we hope to collect much more detailed infor-<br />
mation on the user’s activity including timestamps of exact<br />
mouse position locations, mouse clicks, and keystrokes. Ul-<br />
timately, it would be an asset to researchers to be able to<br />
“playback” the task by watching the worker’s mouse move-<br />
ments in a short video in order to gain greater insight into<br />
how respondents answer surveys.19 This would help iden-<br />
tify satisficing behavior in a way that would go undetected<br />
using other rigid rules, but would be obvious from watching<br />
a video (e.g., instantaneously and haphazardly clicking on<br />
random answer choices).<br />

Internet browsers and was too noisy to use in analysis.<br />

Table 2 shows the main results of the experiment. In<br />
short, we find that the Kapcha treatment increases the pro-<br />
portion of respondents that pass the instructional manip-<br />
ulation check (the IMC pass rate) relative to other treat-<br />
ments but causes more people to leave the task midway.<br />
We find the Kapcha treatment induces a highly significant<br />
effect on question A, but not on question B. Overall, we<br />
confirm both of Thaler’s [21] economic effects if we combine<br />
all treatments.<br />

as compared with the Control treatment. This result is not<br />
surprising since by forcing some respondents to spend more<br />
time on our survey, we effectively are lowering their hourly<br />
wage and testing their patience. As we might expect, the<br />
Exhortation treatment, which reminds the respondent of the<br />
importance of our survey, slightly lowers attrition (though<br />
not significantly).21<br />

Ordinarily, survey designers seek to minimize attrition<br />
(i.e., maximize completion rates of their surveys). However,<br />
in the MTurk environment, where the number of potential<br />
respondents is larger than the desired sample size, the re-<br />
searcher may want to restrict the sample to those who yield<br />
the highest quality data.22 If the decision to leave a survey<br />
midway through indicates that these people are “less seri-<br />
ous”, we probably would not want them in our sample.23<br />
Note that going forward, we only analyze tasks that were<br />
fully completed (i.e. workers who did not attrit).<br />
3.2 Kapcha Alone is a Successful Mechanism<br />
for Reducing Satisficing<br />
We investigate the IMC pass rate by experimental treat-<br />
ment and demographic controls.<br />
Table 4: IMC pass rate (%) by treatments with com-<br />
parisons<br />
IMC comparisons (p-value)<br />
Pass<br />

Exhortation 76.4 0.057 &lt; 0.001***<br />
Timing control 83.9 0.076<br />
Kapcha 90.2<br />
21Assuming that the true difference in the proportion of at-<br />
trition between the Control and Exhortation treatment was<br />
3.4%, we would need 620 observations in both treatments to<br />
have an 80% chance of detecting it.<br />
22In many survey situations such as surveying current mem-<br />
bers of an organization, maximizing the response rate is a<br />
good strategy. However, in academic research, especially be-<br />
havioral economics and psychology, weeding out non-serious<br />
respondents may be desirable.<br />
23[16] discusses how excluding data based on whether people<br />
fail the instructional manipulation check may lead to a non-<br />
representative population. This is a concern that should be<br />
considered by the researcher, but is unlikely to be relevant<br />
unless the non-representative subset of workers would bias<br />
the study.<br />
Table 4 illustrates that the Control and Exhortation treat-<br />
ments differ significantly from the Kapcha treatment.24 The<br />
difference between the Timing Control and Kapcha was al-<br />
most significant (p = 0.076). We suspect this difference is<br />
real but we most likely do not have enough data to detect<br />
it.25<br />

Table 5 demonstrates that the only experimental treat-<br />
ment which significantly impacts the IMC pass rate is the<br />
Kapcha fade-in treatment, increasing the pass rate by 12.8±<br />
4.0% (p &lt; 0.01). Controlling for demographics26 makes the<br />
effect more statistically significant while leaving the esti-<br />
mate unchanged (p &lt; 0.001). As expected, controlling for<br />
demographics also significantly improves the overall fit of<br />
the model, as measured by R2. Demographic factors that<br />
affect the IMC pass rate are discussed in section 3.4.<br />
Are the higher IMC pass rates in those groups simply<br />
the result of “less serious” respondents removing themselves<br />
from our sample? We investigate whether the higher attri-<br />
tion rates in the Kapcha treatment can explain the differ-<br />
ences in IMC pass rates we have been exploring.<br />
Under the most conservative assumptions, we assume that<br />
all of the additional workers who left the Kapcha would have<br />
stayed and subsequently failed the IMC. More specifically,<br />
we assume that the differential attrition between the Kapcha<br />
and the Control treatments (13.3% - 5.6% = 7.7%) stayed<br />
and fail the IMC (188×7.7% = 14 new failing workers). This<br />
lower IMC pass rate would become 83.05% which is greater<br />
24two-sample, two-tailed z-tests<br />
25If the true proportions were equal to the means that we<br />
observed, we would need 492 observations in each treatment<br />
to have an 80% chance of detecting it.<br />
26The other covariates in table 5 represent covariates that<br />
were not significant and jointly, barely significant. These in-<br />
clude frequency of survey-taking on MTurk, hours per week<br />
on MTurk, earning per week on MTurk, task day of week,<br />
task hour of day, reported multitasking behavior, minutes<br />
since HIT was listed, and average time spent on first 30<br />
questions.<br />

two-sample z-test). Under these conservative assumptions,<br />
attrition can only explain 5.65% of the total 12.8% effect, or<br />
44% of Kapcha’s success. It is reasonable to assume that the<br />
Kapcha adds an additional boost beyond merely annoying<br />
people until they leave.<br />
3.3 Finding Larger Effects in the Economic<br />
Behavior Questions<br />
Assuming that the subtle word changes from questions A<br />
and B cause real differences, we hypothesize that the largest<br />
effects in both questions will be found within the Kapcha<br />
treatment which is designed to force people to pay close<br />
attention to the words in the question text.<br />
Tables 6 and 7 show the effect of subtle word changes<br />
on the price subjects pay for a soda when it comes from<br />
a “fancy resort” and the increased intent to go to a game<br />
whose tickets were “paid handsomely” for as opposed to<br />
received for free.<br />
Overall, workers would pay $0.24 more for sodas bought at<br />
a “fancy resort” over a “run-down grocery store” (p &lt; 0.01).<br />
As expected, in our Timing control and Kapcha treatments,<br />
this effect is stronger than average and is largest and highly<br />
statistically significant in the Kapcha treatment. Control-<br />
ling for demographics leaves this result unchanged, but sub-<br />
stantially improves the overall fit of our model.<br />
Overall, workers who paid for the football ticket were more<br />
likely to go than workers who received the ticket for free<br />
with a difference of 0.37 intention units on a nine-point scale<br />
(p &lt; 0.05). The effect was not robust when controlling for<br />
demographic variables.<br />
The effect of questions B’s phrasal change is estimated to<br />
be between 0.29 and 0.37 depending on whether we control<br />
for demographics. In no individual treatment are there sig-<br />
nificant differences both with and without control variables.<br />
That said, the Timing control and the Control treatment<br />
appear to have a larger effect. However, these results are<br />
barely significant and vacillate upon the introduction or re-<br />
moval of the demographic controls. We consider these effects<br />
to be spurious and conclude that the standard errors in each<br />
treatment are too large (approximately 0.31 to 0.44 depend-<br />
ing on the treatment) relative to the hypothesized effect size.<br />
Most likely, there was not enough data to detect the small<br />
effects given the considerable spread in responses.<br />
The analysis of question A lends legitimacy to the Kapcha<br />
treatment’s power to reduce satisficing. However, we were<br />
unable to draw conclusions from the responses to question B.<br />
We again note that both investigations were underpowered.<br />
We hope to get more data in the future so we can use the<br />
effects found in questions A and B to proxy for satisficing<br />
behavior.<br />
3.4 Observations on theMTurkSurvey­taking<br />
Population<br />
MTurkers Beat Stanford and NYU Students<br />
We compare the IMC pass rates from [16] with our data. In<br />
[16], using n = 213 New York University undergraduates,<br />
the IMC pass rate was 54%, which is lower than our Control<br />
group (n = 167) with a pass rate of 77.3% (p &lt; 0.001). This<br />
Control treatment pass rate is similar to the 82.5% pass rate<br />
in [16] during administration of a paper and pencil exam<br />
using n = 336 Stanford university undergraduates who were<br />
believed to be “motivated” (because they were interested in<br />
either a major or minor in psychology).<br />
Demographic and Behavioral Drivers<br />
Which demographic groups paid the closest attention to our<br />
survey? In table 5, we find that women on average pass the<br />
IMC 7.7 ± 3.1% more often than men (p &lt; 0.05). We find<br />
that older workers do better than younger workers; 26–35<br />
year olds pass 11.4±4.0% more often (p &lt; 0.01); 36–45 year<br />
olds pass 16.3 ± 4.3% more often (p &lt; 0.001); and workers<br />
over 45 years of age pass 17.1±4.6% more often (p &lt; 0.001).<br />
We also find that workers who completed college pass 4.2%<br />
more often (this result was nearly significant).<br />
Two of our variables which measure respondent engage-<br />
ment, the NFC and self-reported motivation, are not signif-<br />
icant when included together and with the number of words<br />
in feedback. However, these variables are both highly sig-<br />
nificant (when included only with the indicator variables for<br />
treatments).<br />
Surprisingly, the worker’s average number of hours worked<br />
on MTurk per week, the average earnings on MTurk per<br />
week, the reported level of multitasking, nor the frequency<br />
of survey-related tasks were significant in predicting IMC<br />
pass rate.<br />
Feedback<br />
The final significant relationship found was the number of<br />
words written as feedback (question #31). We find that for<br />
each word of additional feedback, the probability of passing<br />
increased by 0.3 ± 0.1%. A one standard deviation change<br />
in the number of words of feedback (equal to 28.2 words) is<br />
associated with an 8.5% increase in the IMC pass rate even<br />
controlling for other measures of engagement. Therefore,<br />
the length of a free response can be used as a proxy for<br />
survey engagement, a result also reported by [1].<br />
We also did a small experiment studying how to incen-<br />
tivize feedback. We varied how much we offered respon-<br />
dents for providing feedback (offering either one, zero or five<br />
cents). The average feedback in the group without a bonus is<br />
28.3 words. Compared with an unpaid bonus, paying a one<br />
cent reward garners 5.0 more words on average (p &lt; 0.05)<br />
and the five cent bonus garners 7.6 more words (p &lt; 0.01).<br />
Further, we could not reject the hypothesis that the two ef-<br />
fects were equal (p = 0.364). This indicates that paying a<br />
minimum bonus of one cent elicits almost as lengthy feed-<br />
back as paying almost five times that much (and roughly<br />
half the value of the full HIT). Interestingly, although we<br />
expected the Exhortation group to provide more feedback<br />
since they were reminded that they were participating in<br />
the study, neither that group nor any other treatments re-<br />
ceived significantly more feedback (although the groups were<br />
jointly significant at the p &lt; .05 level).<br />
Furthermore, the workers are eager to give feedback. Re-<br />
searchers can rapidly pilot their studies and get real-time<br />
feedback on how they are perceived by survey-takers.<br />
Asking feedback also gave us a wealth of insight into how<br />
survey respondents perceived our various treatments includ-<br />
ing the Kapcha. One danger of setting the reading speed too<br />
slow for fast readers was illustrated by this worker from Col-<br />
orado Springs, CO:27<br />
27We recorded each worker’s IP address which allowed us to<br />
determine their location.<br />

soda cost... I do not like the black background<br />
color, it hurts my eyes when contrasted with the<br />
white. Would prefer a 7 point likert scale if pos-<br />
sible.”<br />
4. DISCUSSION<br />
The main goal of our study is to investigate a survey plat-<br />
form that reduces satisficing across the board. We propose<br />
the idea of Kapcha, a method which involves slowing people<br />
down by fading-in the question text, thereby accentuating<br />
each word. We have found evidence that Kapcha has the<br />
potential to reduce satisficing in online surveys. We then<br />
open-source the platform (see Appendix A) so that the sur-<br />
veyor can simply “plugin” the platform and be confident of<br />
obtaining more accurate results.<br />
MTurk workers that participated in a survey task employ-<br />
ing the Kapcha passed an instructional manipulation check<br />
about 13% more often than those who were given a stan-<br />
dard survey and it is reasonable to assume that this pass<br />
rate can be used as a proxy for general satisficing behavior.<br />
At most, only 44% of this effect can be explained by a higher<br />
proportion of people leaving the Kapcha survey task.<br />
The treatment where we merely exhorted the participant<br />
to pay more attention had no significant effect on satisficing.<br />
The treatment that imposed a waiting period but did not<br />
accentuate the words, did better than the standard survey<br />
group, but the difference was not significant.<br />
Upon analyzing demographic data, we find the segment<br />
of workers least likely to satisfice are females over the age of<br />
26 who leave thoughtful feedback.<br />
We must also emphasize that the trick question was very<br />
difficult and requires carefully reading the fine print.28 As<br />
a testament to the quality of work on MTurk, we find it<br />
absolutely incredible that even in the Control treatment,<br />
people pass the trick question with such high proportion.<br />
5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS<br />
Our study indicates that using Kapcha can significantly<br />
increase the amount of attention respondents give to reading<br />
directions and answering questions. For future research, we<br />
would like to study how the Kapcha is affected by other<br />
variables such as levels of motivation or monetary incentives<br />
as well as among different populations. We would also like to<br />
conduct further experiment with how the Kapcha could be<br />
optimized using principles of psychology and perception so<br />
as to draw the attention of respondents. Finally, we would<br />
like to design a survey task that is deliberately designed<br />
to impose a high cognitive burden and cause respondents to<br />
satisfice. Testing the Kapcha under these circumstances will<br />
provide a clearer picture of its power.<br />
Kapcha may be moderated by other variables<br />
For one reason or another, the Kapcha may be more effective<br />
on certain populations. For instance, the degree to which a<br />
respondent pays closer attention when being forced to wait,<br />
or when text is faded in, may differ by language or culture.<br />
A study drawing participants from various countries may<br />
elucidate its differential effectiveness.<br />
Apart from interactions with demographic variables, the<br />
effectiveness of the Kapcha may vary with monetary or non-<br />
monetary incentives.<br />
For example, can you pay people to pay more attention?<br />
If people are paid higher monetary awards, does that reduce<br />
the advantages of using a Kapcha? It could be that incen-<br />
tives simply cannot induce people to pay more attention<br />
beyond a certain point and that the only way to increase<br />
attention to the highest levels is through attention-grabbing<br />
techniques.<br />

Though not statistically significant, it appears that telling<br />
respondents that their answers will be used for research (our<br />
Exhortation treatment) motivates people to complete our<br />
survey at higher rates. This is most likely because reminding<br />
them about the survey’s research value imbues the survey<br />
with a sense of meaning (a similar result was found in [4]).<br />
Therefore, it may be wise to insert an exhortative statement<br />
into the Kapcha to get an “added boost.”<br />
The Kapcha appearance should be optimized<br />
Further, we would like to experiment with the particulars<br />
of the Kapcha presentation. In our experiment, we used<br />
white text on a black background and faded the words in<br />
at 250 words per minute. Does the choice of color schemes<br />
and text font matter?29 What is the speed at which words<br />
should fade-in to optimize attention to our survey?<br />
Research suggests that forcing a person to direct their gaze<br />
toward an area correlates highly with the attention they pay<br />
to that area [8] and the psychology of perception is ripe with<br />
many other examples of how color, contrast, and movement<br />
could be used to draw attention.<br />
We must admit that many of our faster reading respon-<br />
dents in the Kapcha group expressed that they did not like<br />
the unfamiliar method of fading-in survey questions (34 of<br />
163 respondents left negative feedback compared with 7 pos-<br />
itive feedbacks). Although it had its desired effect of in-<br />
creasing the attention people paid to the survey questions,<br />
we certainly would like to further calibrate the Kapcha so<br />
as to slow respondents down without annoying them.<br />
We propose a survey task that measures satisficingmore<br />
generally<br />
The IMC and the behavioral questions are both noisy and<br />
incomplete measures of satisficing. Using only these re-<br />
sponse variables as proxies for satisficing is a weakness in<br />
our present study.<br />
We propose to create a survey task that has several mea-<br />
sures of satisficing in order to demonstrate that the Kapcha<br />
can reduce satisficing in the broadest context.<br />
We will review the findings from the literature of sur-<br />
vey response psychology (e.g. [15], [13], [22]) which provide<br />
29Many respondents complained that the white-on-black<br />
background was distracting which may have affected how<br />
well the Kapcha worked.<br />
guidance for how to design surveys to minimize participant<br />
satisficing. Using these principles, we will reverse-engineer<br />
a survey that is deliberately constructed so that respondents<br />
are likely to satisfice. We will then see how well the Kapcha<br />
prevents satisficing even under the most difficult of circum-<br />
stances.<br />
To offer an example, [14] provides a framework for how<br />
respondents satisfice depending on the structure of ques-<br />
tions, the survey’s difficulty, the respondent’s ability, and<br />
the respondent’s motivation. Three commonly cited exam-<br />
ples of satisficing due to question structure are response or-<br />
der effects whereby people choose the first answer of surveys,<br />
no opinion filters whereby people who are lazy will sooner<br />
choose “no opinion” than take the time to think of what<br />
their opinion is, and acquiescence bias. where respondents<br />
are more likely to choose “agree” if the choices are “agree<br />
or disagree”. The difficulty of a survey can be related to the<br />
“readability” of the survey questions (higher readability im-<br />
plies shorter question length and basic vocabulary [3]). The<br />
respondent’s motivation may be related to how meaningful<br />
they perceive the task to be. Presumably, higher ability re-<br />
spondents and respondents who are motivated would also<br />
tend to satisfice less.<br />
If the Kapcha is found to be effective here, we will be<br />
confident that the Kapcha method prevents satisficing under<br />
very general conditions.<br />
Data Sharing<br />
We cross-validated some of the self-reported demographic in-<br />
formation using data provided by Panos Ipeirotis from [11].<br />
23 people who reported their age in our survey also reported<br />
their date of birth in [11]’s survey. In all but one case, the<br />
age and date of birth were consistent. This offers evidence<br />
that even over a time period of more than 6 months, time<br />
invariant demographic data can be reliably collected on sep-<br />
arate occasions. Broadly speaking, MTurk workers seem to<br />
be honest in sharing their personal information.<br />
Data sharing among academics using MTurk provides not<br />
only the possibility of validating data, but also of using de-<br />
mographics or other covariates from one study as controls<br />
in others. For example, in our present study, we evaluated<br />
respondent’s Need for Cognition which could be a useful<br />
control variable in other studies. In many cases, it may be<br />
highly useful to match demographic and other behavioral<br />
characteristics as a way to increase precision without us-<br />

studies is especially beneficial in the case of natural field ex-<br />

We propose that researchers agree on a central, shared<br />
repository of data related to the MTurk workers and offer<br />
an API for easy access.<br />

A. TURKSURVEYOR: AN OPEN­SOURCE<br />
EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM<br />
We would like to introduce “TurkSurveyor”, an open-<br />
source experimental system designed for running surveys (or<br />
survey-based experiments) on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.<br />
TurkSurveyor is written in a mixture of Ruby (on Rails),<br />
HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is available under the MIT<br />
license at http://code.google.com/p/turksurveyor/ and in-<br />
cludes an instruction manual. The goal of its development<br />
is to have a simple push-button system which allows one,<br />
with a minimum of customization, to use MTurk to collect<br />
data for a custom survey.<br />
B. REPLICATION<br />
