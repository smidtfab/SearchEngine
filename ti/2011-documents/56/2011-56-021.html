CloudCrowd is an alternative workplace to Mechanical Turk. You can access it on Facebook at <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/cloudcrowd/invite/f3474b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/cloudcrowd/invite/f3474b</a><br/> <br/>We have a lot of respect for Mechanical Turk, but we decided to create a better environment for distributed labor. CloudCrowd has all the basics you'd expect but it also has some things you won't find on Mechanical Turk, including:<br/> <br/>1) A more efficient user interface. You don't have to spend time &quot;accepting&quot; work or loading in entire pages. We put considerable effort into the issue of &quot;how we can help workers increase their efficiency&quot;.<br/> <br/> 2) PayPal-based payment. You can use CloudCrowd from any country that works with PayPal. And we pay the PayPal fees.<br/> <br/>3) Juicy referral programs.  We expect that some assertive workers are going to build large Personal Crowds and end up earning a good deal of money by managing and facilitating their Crowd's work. We also will be rolling out a referral program for people who refer projects to us.<br/> <br/>4) Credibility Ratings. We spent a lot of time doing deep design on the issue of Credibility. We don't like the Mechanical Turk approach of relying on whether or not a Requestor approved your work. Our approach is different, and more complex. In many cases, work you do will get reviewed by other workers. If you get graded well, your Credibility will rise. We think that overall, workers will prefer our approach.<br/> <br/>We also have some key improvements below the surface that are targeted at empowering Requestors:<br/> <br/>5) Crowd Collaborative Review is built-in. A Requestor can click a button to have work reviewed by other members of the crowd. The feedback is automatic. Work receiving too low a rating gets rejected and redone. The Requestor can dial in any amount of review. Since review is fast, once a system like CloudCrowd is making everything work together, adding in review doesn't increase the cost very much. The benefit? The Requestor doesn't have to hand audit the work that's being done, or rely on something as rudimentary as a worker's previous acceptance rate.<br/> <br/>6) Workflow Linkage. Our system makes it easy for a project to be broken down into multiple specialized parts. The output from one project can flow into another project. Review stages can be easily added in. Sure, you can do this in Mechanical Turk if you have a programmer handy and a bunch of time. Or you can contact a specialist intermediary and pay them to craft a custom solution for you. Our goal is to make it much easier to snap these pieces together using simple wizards. If Mechanical Turk is like DOS, we're shooting for being like Macintosh OS X.<br/> <br/>What's not implemented yet: We're in beta, and there's a lot that we haven't turned on yet.<br/> <br/>1) We don't have API's or self-serve tools for Project Sponsors (&quot;Requestors&quot;) to inject work. For now, if you want to try using our system for work, you need to contact us directly (you'll find us very responsive)<br/> <br/>2) We only have activated a few projects, as we roll our system out.<br/> <br/>3) We don't have qualification tests implemented yet<br/> <br/>4) You currently need to have a Facebook account to use CloudCrowd We know that we're making a lot of lofty claims here, and that our service is just leaving the nest. We're confident, though, that we can deliver an excellent work environment that will create excellent opportunities for workers and providers of work. We hope you'll give CloudCrowd a try. Feedback from veteran Turkers would be very welcome. We want to make CloudCrowd the most worker-friendly workplace.<br/> <br/>Respectfully,<br/>Alex Edelstein<br/>CEO<br/>CloudCrowd<br/><a href="http://www.cloudcrowd.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.cloudcrowd.com</a><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by spamgirl on Sept 24, 2009, 7:15pm<br/><br/>Do you allow people to post SEO jobs?

It's important for us to know how what we're doing is being perceived, and we appreciate the honest reaction.<br/><br/>To answer a few questions and respond to some of the comments:<br/><br/>1.  There was a typo in the link, it's apps, not app.  The correct link, without the referral code is: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/cloudcrowd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/cloudcrowd</a><br/>To learn more about the company, visit: <a href="http://www.cloudcrowd.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloudcrowd.com</a><br/><br/>2.  Spamgirl asked:  &quot;Do you allow people to post SEO jobs? What about affiliate signups? Digg/Stumble/Twitter/Facebook/blog posts? What will you do to stop them if you don't allow it?&quot; <br/><br/>--We don't allow SEO, affiliate sign-ups, etc... When a company wants to put work on our platform, it has to go through our design and engineering process first. Unlike Mechanical Turk, there is no public front-end where companies can post projects.  We do all of the project set-up and management ourselves.<br/><br/>This limits the work to legitimate projects from companies we have vetted.  <br/><br/>3.  The Grinder said it sounds like, &quot;a good old-fashioned pyramid scam.&quot;  <br/><br/>I appreciate your feedback because we need to know what people think, but I'm not sure what part of our referral system you think is a scam. No one ever pays us or buys anything from us.  It's just a referral program.  If you refer people, you get paid if they work. If they don't, you don't.  You are not required to refer people, and there's no cost to refer people. <br/><br/><br/>4.  Boxers3 was concerned about our request for Facebook access.<br/><br/>Again-- it's good to know how this is perceived.   If you go to the link we provided without knowing anything about us, it's understandable that you'd be concerned about having to provide your Facebook login.   You may be more comfortable logging into Facebook first, and then accessing the application.<br/><br/>If you check out other apps, we aren't asking for access that's any different than what the vast majority of apps ask for.  The profile information we access will be used to help match the workforce to projects that may be a good fit for them. <br/><br/>5.  Diddum asked why the application is on Facebook.<br/><br/>We have several good-sized projects in our pipeline already, and we viewed Facebook as place to tap a large workforce and grow through virality more quickly than we could outside a social network platform.  <br/><br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by jodyb2 on Sept 29, 2009, 10:34pm<br/><br/>Well, I took the plunge and signed up for Crowd Cloud on Facebook.  Even made an account for myself....no photos or anything like that.<br/><br/>In my life before being laid off, I was an English as a Second Language teacher and I seriously wanted to get into re-writing the terrible English I read on Chinese web pages.  And low and behold, the first assignments I took were to re-write web pages that were on Chinese sites.  And right now, it looks like there are lots of those kind of assignments right now.<br/><br/>So, this could just be the thing for me since I have fairly strong writing skills and the background in ELL.  <br/><br/>Who knows?  I'll let you all know when I get my first PayPal deposit.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by tammyjo on Sept 29, 2009, 11:42pm<br/><br/>I agree, the pay-pal thing is great, but after test driving this site, I'd say you guys still have a lot of work ahead of you. <br/>I understand using Facebook as a backdrop, but I think you're going to find a lot of us seasoned outsourcers wishing we didn't have to go through that particular platform (we're also seasoned skeptics).<br/>Plus, with only 4 different kinds of jobs to pick from right now, it's hard to pass a valuable judgment on so many aspects one comes to expect from a site like this.<br/>You have piqued my interest though, and you can be sure that I will be keeping my eye on this one. With proper nurturing, there's definitely potential here.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by u0402215 on Sept 29, 2009, 11:58pm<br/><br/>I'm apprehensive about putting this thing on my Facebook and letting more people know about it - I hate to say this but it's in our interest to let as few people know about this ... Just see what's happened to MTurk -  after a huge bunch of workers signed up on MTurk the no. of HITS we want to do and manage to catch has dropped drastically as well as the amount of payout per HIT.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by jodyb2 on Sept 30, 2009, 6:32am<br/><br/>Here is how I would sum up Crowd Cloud.  Last night after writing my assignments, I left the site.  My assignments which I wrote will be analyzed and graded by others on Crowd Cloud.  Then, those reviewers will give me a grade based upon the quality of the work I did.  That grade goes back to Crowd Cloud, which will then increase or decrease my credibility rating.  As my credibility rating goes up or down, I will then get more assignments or less assignments.  Here is their statement on the site:<br/><br/>Your Credibility Score: 29<br/>About Your Score:<br/><br/>Your CloudCrowd Credibility Score is how we rate the likelihood that you'll do quality work in the future. Your Credibility Score will determine whether you can continue to work on projects at CloudCrowd, as well as the type of projects you are able to work on.<br/><br/>It takes hard work to gain Credibility on CloudCrowd, and it is easy to quickly lose credibility if you don't protect it. At the same time, we realize that from time to time, even the most reliable of workers will make mistakes.<br/><br/>    * When you first join you will see quick gains in your credibility for turning in good answers.<br/>    * Each task you do will be graded internally: The better your answers, the more your score will improve, and the worse your answers the more your score will decrease.<br/>    * A series of mistakes will have a magnified downward effect.<br/><br/>Protect and increase your Credibility Score by following these steps:<br/><br/>    * Stick to tasks for which you feel you are well qualified.<br/>    * Carefully read all instructions.<br/>    * Only submit answers that represent your best efforts.<br/><br/>If you follow these guidelines, your Credibility Score will increase, along with the number of tasks for which you are qualified.<br/><br/>So, it reminds me a lot of the tasks that we do that are reviewed by the requester on mTurk.<br/><br/>Food for thought . . . . no one has graded my assignments yet.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by u0402215 on Sept 30, 2009, 10:42am<br/><br/>It seems that there's a &quot;majority rules&quot; system at work here ... <br/>There's this statement in the FAQ - <br/>&quot;CloudCrowd uses a proprietary method to cross-check your answers with answers from other workers ... &quot;<br/><br/>I've got a few rejections for my grading of other peoples' rewrites which I suspect might be due to other people submitting junk results for their grading of these rewrites. <br/><br/>This reminds me of the old Todd Dickerson (or something) sentence rewrite jobs which any Tom, Dick or Harry on MTurk can judge the quality of the sentence rewrite - heck if you're &quot;lucky&quot; enough you get to  judge your own rewrite - which led to honest workers suffering because some jerk reviewer decided to breeze through the whole lot of review hits by simply choosing the 'rewrite is unacceptable' option regardless of the actual quality of the rewrite.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by tammyjo on Sept 30, 2009, 11:34am<br/><br/>I'm having the same experience with rejections. Majority rule only works if the majority is actually doing quality work, which in all honesty, is probably not going to happen at first. While people are still test driving the site, it's less likely that they're going to take the work seriously. <br/><br/>Suggestion: don't remove the human element from the grading system just yet, if too many sincere workers get a lot of rejections right off the bat, they won't be back. <hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by cloudcrowd on Sept 30, 2009, 3:22pm<br/><br/>u0402215:  The system has checks and balances which should make it unlikely that you'll get rejected if just a single reviewer rates your work poorly.

It's no big deal.<br/><br/>I'm really impressed with the interface.  It allows you to complete a task and move on to the next seamlessly.  It was certainly designed with the worker in mind, and the load times are very fast.  Nice job.<br/><br/>The tasks themselves take care and attention, of course, but I find them interesting and the pay rate seems fair for the amount of work you do.  A rewrite of 5 paragraphs max for $1.50 is good, although be warned that some of the rewrites involve technical information that needs to be formatted intelligently.  Some may enjoy this, some may not.<br/><br/>All in all, I like this app a lot, and the service it provides is very needed given some of the butchered English I've seen on some of these websites.  Business English is crucial when selling to the US market, and I would think any import company would welcome a professional rewrite.  <br/><br/>On edit: the only suggestion I'd make is to give a more comprehensive explanation of your rating.  So far, all of my work that's been graded has been given a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; rating, but my credibility rating is only 46.  I have no idea if this is good, bad, or otherwise.  Is this 46 out of a hundred?  Some benchmark would be useful.<br/><br/>On second edit: my credibility rating is now up to 72, so it appears that a low sampling rate can have a big effect.  Still, it would be helpful to have a benchmark.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by connielee on Oct 1, 2009, 6:04pm<br/><br/>This is probably a stupid question, but when this says it needs the info for my friends, what exactly does it need that for?

I just wasted one hour for nothing =p <br/><br/>Edit : And they're late in paying as well.  Normally I get an e-mail from Paypal at around 10 am at my local GMT+8 time but right now I haven't got anything from them.<br/><br/>OK just to wax philosophical  :  Well ok I admit that by very strict standards what I'm capable of turning the original Chinese text into would fall into the 'fair' category of being somewhat amateurish because my English isn't that bad . On the other hand I'd think that attempts by most of us to rewrite the English text found in Chinese websites would,  by the definition of a 'fair' grading, 'stand out if mixed in with major US-based corporate websites' simply <i>because China companies tend to include things in their company profiles that US companies won't.</i> <br/><br/>For instance, those of you who have worked on the Chinese website texts would find that the Chinese tend to include things like <i>very</i> extensive lists of all the things they produce, their company philosophies which sound vaguely corny in English, and tend to end with sentences along the lines of 'we sincerely look forward to being friends with all people from all over the world; let us work hand in hand towards the brighter future'. The fact that these things are included are not because the websites authors are trying to be corny or flowery or otherwise funny in their English but because the original Chinese texts in the websites tend to say exactly the same things. I know because I had to look at the original Chinese text to make sense of some of the more unintelligible English sentences. The Chinese versions of the texts DO NOT sound corny - if anything, they are exude pride and confidence in the companies (although people in China might themselves describe them as being somewhat bureaucratese.)  It's just that some things, particularly company philosophies, which come across as rather snappy in their original Chinese versions, don't translate very well into English. <br/><br/>Oh well - enough of my rants - I'm just extremely pissed off that two of my edits have been graded as 'poor' which according to the grading criteria is the grade for garbage. <br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by u0402215 on Oct 3, 2009, 6:28am<br/><br/>Hey ppl ... I'm just thinking - is the recent batch of rejections that we've been getting occurring because<br/>1) all of us here who're doing the grading honestly believe that they're giving the edits / website selections the grades that they believe, but due to differences in perceptions of what constitutes good English gave different grades to the same rewrites resulting in rejects for the gradings for everyone.  One instance where I see this happening is for the Italian sites that appear on the grade website recommendations  - I'd in strict honesty have rated the submissions for most of these Italian sites as 'poor' or 'fair' for the 'review website selections'  since their English isn't (to me) atrocious, although I try my best to spot mistakes in them that would justify my giving the person submitting them at least a 'fair' grade so that he can get paid.  Maybe there are people out there much more fluent than I am in the English language who honestly find the English in these Italian sites bad. <br/><br/>2) the &quot;requestor&quot; has stepped in yesterday and has much higher standards than most of us here, so that what is acceptable to most of us s not to the requester and as a result we began to get rejections for edits and gradings which have previously been accepted after grading from just fellow workers but not the requestor itself.  <br/><br/>3) there're people out there who're submitting junk gradings that are adversely pulling down our grades. OK cloudcrowd did say that it's highly unlikely for a single scammer putting in junk gradings for our work to result in our work being rejected. On the other hand if I had wanted to be a scammer doing junk gradings to earn a quick buck I could easily create multiple Facebook accounts and Paypal accounts to go with them.  Unlike Amazon payments whereby a scammer probably wouldn't be able to accumulate enough money in the account to buy much worthwhile before being banned and cannot transfer money between different Amazon payments accounts easily, a ban of a scammer in Facebook can be overcome just by the scammer setting up a new Facebook and Paypal accounts, and he can easily transfer money from the banned Paypal accounts to the new ones to accumulate reasonable sums of money. Further, if a scammer's  persistent enough to maintain enough accounts and work at them constantly it's possible, at least currently given the low number of workers on Cloudcrowd, for him to be able to approve his own junk work from his various accounts.  Maybe this is why we get some well written websites appearing in the edit tasks.  By the same token, a scammer is able to use his multiple accounts to give bad ratings to the work of other workers to drive them away. This reduces the competition for work as well as increases his chances of being able to approve his own junk work from his multiple accounts.  <br/><br/>If this is his game plan I hate to say that he's succeeding -  it seems that a lot of people in this board are already getting apprehensive about doing further work. I've PMed cloudcrowd on Turker Nation about my rejections for the edit paragraphs tasks and won't be working on them again until either they've confirmed that it's the requester who's finding my English inadequate and hence rejected my edits or otherwise clarified the situation. <br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by u0402215 on Oct 3, 2009, 7:14am<br/><br/>Oh well I guess I'm feeling particularly verbose today (and it's a slow MTurk day and I keep on getting rejections on Cloudcrowd so I'm not really going to touch it) so I'll just rant a bit more. (Sorry ... haha) <br/><br/>For one thing I guess the 5 paragraphs requirement isn't a very realistic one since most company profiles don't have information that would logically go into 5 paragraphs - 4 seems to be a better one, and I wouldn't really b*tch about it if they cut the pay down to $1 for 4 paragraphs. The reason why I suggested 4 paragraphs is because most Chinese manufacturer company profiles follow the following template - <br/><br/>1st paragraph has things like ... <br/>&quot;The Su Jiao Qiu Co, Ltd. is founded in 1990 and is a leading manufacturer and exporter of plastic balls based at XX city of YY Province. XX city has scenery that is very nice and is home of the plastic industry. It is near XX highway and YY airport so the traffic links are are very developed. We are a Province High Technology Enterprise and Export Enterprise.&quot;<br/><br/>2nd paragragh has a very exhaustive (and exhausting) list of the things the factory makes and the equipment it has ... <br/><br/>&quot;Our main products are various kinds of plastic balls like Yellow Plastic balls, green plastic balls, 10 inch plastic balls,  9.99 inch balls, 9.98 Inch Balls, 9.97 Inch Balls, Orange Balls, White Balls with Orange Strips, Blue Balls with Pink Polka Dots, Big Balls, Small Balls, Spherical Balls,  Elipsodial Balls, Square Balls,  Octahedral Balls etc. We can also do OEM/ODM work according to customer specifications. Our factory has the Mk 99 Synchrotron, the PECVD machine, JEOL SEMs, Janis Cyrostat, Sputtering Machine, AFM, MFM, Spin Resolved Kerr Spectroscopy Machine, Mk1 Plastic Ball Making Machine, the Mk 2 10 inch plastic Ball Machine, the Orange 9.12 Inch Plastic Ball machine imported from Japan and Germany and other machines. &quot;<br/><br/>3rd paragraph has things along the lines of, <br/><br/>&quot;Our company philospohy is &quot;Love our customers like our parents,  build the reputation and earn the money&quot; We innovate constantly to develop the new technology. We have superior professional staff, superior techniques and scientific management philosophy.  All our people's past 10 years' hard work and striving won us the ISO299792458 ceritification. All our products are TUV, FBI, CIA and KGB Certified. Through high technology we offer you excellent customer services,  good quality, timely delivery and competitive prices. Our balls are bouncy and fun  . This is why they are well known by customers and exported to many countries and regions like the USA, Southeast Asia and Australia.&quot;<br/><br/>and the fourth paragraph things like<br/><br/>&quot;We sincerely hope that we can make friends with partners from all over the world and work together shoulder-in-shoulder, hand in hand for mutual benefit. We look forward from hearing from you. &quot;  <br/><br/>I just thought that if a manufacturer has put in all of the above things and decided to squeeze everything into less than 5 paragraphs then the worker shouldn't be penalized if he's able to submit only four paragraphs because that is the number of paragraphs the website authors have put in. <br/><br/>Maybe rather than counting paragraphs a better criteria is to use word count - if need be the various things the company makes and the machines in its factories can be excluded from the word count. (Along with the address, phone numbers and website addresses which some companies are wont to put in the main text area of their websites.)  There are a quite a number of website writers who tend to write extremely long paragraphs - there are some who'd put the equivalent of all the above content into one single paragraph, and it doesn't seem very fair to the worker if the original website writers don't get the hang of separating their text into bite-sized paragraphs.  (Though on the flip side there are others who over-do it and litter their profile pages with lots of one sentence paragraphs. )  <hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by jodyb2 on Oct 3, 2009, 9:37am<br/><br/>Your points are well taken.  I'm a fairly proficient writer so the rewrites are not too hard for me although I struggle to know exactly what the company feels is important to their customers.  I guess this would be a hard tasks for anyone to do unless they could speak directly to a company representative.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the pay for these tasks is so low.  If I had a network in China to tap into, I imagine I could make $100 or more for these re-writes.  <br/><br/>OK, so our task maybe is to just cut out the Cloud Crowd people, go directly to the Chinese manufacturers and start our own Virtual Assistant network where we re-write Chinese web pages.  It might take a little longer to do . . . . but if we've been keeping track of our re-writes, we been copying and pasting all the company information . . . .and then again, I may be living in a dream world.<br/><br/>Plus, by reading all these web sites,  we get the added benefit of learning more about the Chinese culture. <br/><br/>This turking gig has opened my eyes to the fact that many companies will pay to have jobs done.

Unless you get rid of 50% of the information in the text - which we're not supposed to do, and if we did we'd end up with about 5 sentences - it's never going to be as polished as what you'd find in the US.  It's when you actually read the grading criteria - which is harsh - against the criteria in the rewrite instructions (Business English) it's easy to see where the confusion is happening.<br/><br/>So many of these Chinese sites follow a format that I suspect they're using a template, or that the same person is selling them an &quot;English&quot; translation.  It's easy to put the text into business English.  It's almost impossible to take this information and make it comparable to what's found in a MAJOR US-based corporation.  Apples and oranges.<br/><br/>A bit of rambling follows, but I've found these tasks both interesting and infuriating.  I spent a couple of hours in Chinese export directories yesterday compiling poorly-written sites, and have you all noticed how new these Chinese plants are and how beautiful the designs are?  Have you noticed that they make everything from solar panels to plasma TV's to industrial compounds to everything under the sun?  All of the things we used to make in the US, while thousands of Turkers here fight for HITS that pay a penny.  There's something very wrong with this picture.<br/><br/>Also in my cruise around export directories I noticed a few things - Chinese website design is at least 10 years behind the US, although I saw a couple of nice uses of Flash.  On occasion I'd have traditional Chinese music blaring at me although on one I was blasted by a Michael Jackson tune.  The most entertaining things I found were on the Contact pages looking for the email addy.  One had an addy that was labeled, &quot;Complain Here&quot;.  Another had a link to &quot;Legal Claims&quot;, which took you to a page of actions against the company for shoddy products.

I posted my thoughts as well.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by cloudcrowd on Oct 4, 2009, 12:45pm<br/><br/>Thanks for the detailed feedback.  We'll be reviewing all of the issues everyone has brought up in-depth this week and I'll have answers back on everything shortly.  In the meantime I wanted to address some of the pressing concerns:<br/><br/>1.  Non-payment for work that was done properly.<br/><br/>We will be doing a thorough review of re-write submissions.<br/>Anyone who did work on this project that should have qualified for payment will get paid.  Please feel free to send me a message here or on the support form under About/Contact Us in the application.<br/><br/>2.  Checks and balances: To clarify things a bit, our process is not a simple &quot;majority rules&quot;.  For every submission reviewed by others we have an internal &quot;confidence&quot; rating that determines how confident we are that the answer maps with how the reviewers rated it.  Submissions with low confidence in the accuracy of the review are automatically routed for additional review.  We take into account the credibility of the reviewers when making these calls.  <br/><br/>3.  Project pricing:  Our goal is to price our projects at a perfect equilibrium where the people working on them feel they're earning a fair rate for the work they're doing, and the projects get done as quickly and accurately as required.<br/><br/>Sometimes it will be important to get the work done very quickly and very accurately, and we'll be able to offer more for a project.  Other times, speed, accuracy, or both will be less important, and we won't be able to pay as much.<br/><br/>Sometimes these parameters will change in the middle of a project, which was the case for the re-write projects.<br/><br/>If we can live with fewer submissions during a project's run, rather than taking it off the board completely, we may leave it up at a lower price.  This allows people who want to continue to work on it to do work they otherwise wouldn't have been able to if we'd just shut it down for a while.<br/><br/>At the same time, if a particular project is moving slowly and we need quicker and/or better results, we'll increase the price in the middle of a project.<br/><br/>The great thing about a platform like CloudCrowd is that we'll know very quickly if we're not paying a fair rate for certain projects, because the projects either won't get done, or they'll be done poorly, and require so much review that we'd be better off just pricing them higher to start.<br/><br/>We greatly appreciate the time everyone here has given to let us know about their experiences, and I will have a more detailed response back up here by the end of the day tomorrow.<br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by justinnachod on Oct 4, 2009, 2:50pm<br/><br/>Let's see whether I get &quot;rejected&quot; for this particular grading task.

May I offer the following suggestions?<br/><br/>1. Currently it doesn't seem quite right that it's a lot easier to build up your credibility ratings by doing lots of the 5 cent review website submission tasks than by doing the paragraph edit tasks.<br/><br/> As things were for the past two days or so when I didn't come across any nonsense submissions myself, it's difficult to go too wrong with the website submissions tasks by just selecting the 'it's not a US company', 'it's the correct e-mail address' and 'it's a good submission' option for every single website that comes along the way without looking at the website at all.  I was able to get my rating up from a low of 70+ back to 90+ within a single morning of work just by doing those. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it's very easy to go wrong with the paragraph edit tasks. Even if a worker conscientiously worked on the paragraph edit,  more than one grammer or spelling mistake he has inadvertently forgotten to fix would, going by the grading criteria strictly, cause his work to be rejected. (To say nothing of malicious scammers submitting nonsense grades for honest good quality edits.) It took me about two days of working on edits to build my credibility from my initial 70+ to 90+. <br/><br/>I thought it'd be fair to moderate the weigh the impact of the work on the credibility rating by say the amount of pay involved with each task or how easy it is to get the task correct or something like that. <br/><br/>2. Since peer worker grading appears to be a key part of the Cloudcrowd work process, I'd think it's important to preserve the integrity of the process by making sure that malicious scammers do not get to grade. I suggest that a lower limit on the credibility ratings be imposed for the grading tasks which new workers would only be able to attain after having submitted quality work for a sizable number of the edit paragraphs or submit website tasks? These two tasks require real work in order to be approved whereas the review website submissions and review edit submissions are basically tasks that involve clicking on buttons. <br/><br/>Having a lower credibility limit on the review tasks would prevent or at least hamper scammers from setting up multiple accounts to approve his own junk submissions while giving junk gradings to others' honest work because the new accounts will not have enough credibility ratings to grade and they might just find it not worth their while to build up the credibility ratings of the new accounts and go away.   <br/><br/>3. Since you guys are going to manually review the submissions anyway it'd be a good opportunity to identify the workers who've submitted good quality work consistently but were perhaps victimized by malicious malicious scammer graders and the scammers who're using multiple accounts to approve their own junk. The scammers should be kicked out and kept out, whereas the good workers should be given higher confidence ratings commensurate with the quality of their work so far. Maybe they can form the core of a trusted grader team or something. <hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by alexed on Oct 5, 2009, 12:35am<br/><br/>Hi guys. I'm the CEO of CloudCrowd. I want to first thank you all for trying our service. I knew when I told our worker services department to post here that we'd get the tough truth. This feedback is invaluable.<br/><br/>It sounds like the Review Rewrites needs some tinkering. I suspect now that the problem is one we never anticipated: there just isn't enough common agreement on just what &quot;good&quot; business English looks like. I suspect we'll raise the threshold for rejecting a review here, and rework the instructions. We'll go through all of the reviews, and provide credit where appropriate. I don't think anyone will find that their time has been wasted. <br/><br/>We're still triggering the PayPal payments manually as we test out the system. You have to be cautious, of course, when you're dealing with money transfer automation. That's why no payments went out Saturday. One went out earlier this evening. I suspect that we will be able to provide daily frequency going forward.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to reproduce luigi's problem contacting us.

Obviously the platform is still in Beta and I'm glad they're being responsive to our feedback.<br/><br/>I agree with the above suggestion that someone should have a certain credibility level in order to grade the texts.  Judging from the mass of submissions last night that were simply cut-and-paste jobs of the original text, or the idiotic LOL's entered into the text box, there's a potential problem with someone new submitting trash and giving themselves a good grade.  This is a good concept and I'd hate to see scammers ruining it for everyone else.<br/><br/>On edit:  another suggestion: when reviewing the links, there needs to be a radio button under item 3 with Other and a text box for an explanation.  I just reviewed a site from Taiwan that had almost no text anywhere on the site - again, someone just submitting junk.  I've also reviewed links that were to link farms that should have been rejected, but there's no mechanism in place to reject the submission on the grounds that the submission itself was invalid.  All we can do is grade the English, and there needs to be an option to flag something that didn't conform to the parameters of the task.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by kaine23 on Oct 5, 2009, 11:25am<br/><br/>What about sites completely in another lanugage?<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by cloudcrowd on Oct 5, 2009, 12:36pm<br/><br/>Luigi-<br/><br/>Thanks again for your feedback.  Regarding your suggestion for a radio button with a text box for an explanation:  We've thought about the same issue.

I have been doing mturk for one week (made about $120 so far).  This morning I worked on croudcloud because I couldn't find hits I wanted to do on mturk.  <br/><br/>There are glitches and problems with both sites.  I like the interface of crowdcloud better than mturk, it seems to go faster.  I did about 50 of the 5-cent tasks.  They were actually fun, I had to laugh at some of the writing.  I may try to do some rewriting for $1.25, but it was so much more work, and I can do one of the 5-cent reviews in a few seconds (if I don't dawdle and read the funny text).  I would spend probably 30 minutes on the rewrites, so it doesn't pay more, and I have to work harder.<br/><br/>I sense that crowdcloud is going to have a cleaner set of tasks, with fewer problems with requesters and scammy tasks.    <br/><br/>Anyway I am enjoying both sites and will be checking them regularly for tasks.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by jodyb2 on Oct 5, 2009, 3:50pm<br/><br/>If I were to tweek the CrowdCloud grading system for the paragraphs, I would add a sixth option-site has been copied and a seventh option-pure junk!<br/><br/>I am confused when my submissions are rejected-it still looks like I will get paid something.

More for you later this afternoon:<br/><br/>1.  As we're reviewing work that was done while we had our credibility glitch and make adjustments, user credibility ratings will change. They will settle down in a day or two.  If you are doing good work, don't be too concerned about your rating in the time being.<br/><br/>2.  There may still be junk entries in the system. We're going to allow users to rate these and weed them out.  If you see a junk entry, just give it a &quot;poor&quot;.<br/><br/>3. Now that the credibility issues are fixed you should see far fewer junk entries in the future.<br/><br/>4.  If your grade for a &quot;Grade Written Text&quot; task is close to what other reviewers have selected, you'll get credit for it.  For example, if you select &quot;excellent&quot; and two other users select &quot;good&quot; you'll still get paid.<br/><br/>5.  When a task is graded, the rating indicates the rating your work was given.  A rating of &quot;weak&quot; means that your answer didn't map well with the grades that other users with high credibility gave.  The glitch in our system caused work that should have been accepted to be rejected, and rated &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;.  <br/><br/>6.  We appreciate the issue where someone is close to good/excellent re-write but doesn't quite make it.  Unfortunately the demands of the end clients are understandably going to be pretty high.  This is one of those tasks where we need nearly perfect quality.  While there's no way for us to currently change the system, we can change the instructions to make sure our expectations are clear, and encourage users to use spell/grammar check before submitting.  <br/><br/>Thanks again for all the great feedback.  We are continually making improvements to the system, and your input is extremely helpful.<br/><br/>-Mark<hr size="1"/><b>Re: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by freep99 on Oct 6, 2009, 2:26pm<br/><br/><br/><b>Quote:</b><table bgcolor="000000" class="bordercolor" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr><td width="100%"><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="quote" width="100%"><tr><td width="100%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="quote" size="1">4.

All credibility scores will be updated and all pending payments for tasks that should have been paid will go out tonight (we're on Pacific time).<br/><br/>While the vast majority of the work being done is good, as we've been doing manual reviews we've noticed a few submissions from users posting here that were correctly rejected.  <br/><br/>The most common reasons for rejections have been:<br/><br/>1. A user did a re-write which improved the original copy but still included multiple typos, spelling errors, or grammar problems.  The original re-write would not earn payment in that case.<br/><br/>2. In the Grade Written Text project we're noticing that some users are apparently reviewing the text without comparing it to the original.  Some users are not making any changes to the original text when they submit what is supposed to be a re-write.  <br/><br/>The task for this project is to rate the re-write, not the original text.  If the re-write doesn't have any changes from the original text then it should be rated &quot;poor&quot;.<br/><br/>If you still feel you have tasks that were rejected unfairly after tonight, please don't hesitate to let me know.<br/><br/>-Mark<hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by u0402215 on Oct 6, 2009, 7:27pm<br/><br/>I don't know if this is a glitch of not but I haven't been able to get a single one of the last eight Grade Edit tasks approved ... I guess someone with a really very high standard of English could justifiably give what I gave 'good' rating a 'fair' while on the other hand someone else who doesn't read the article carefully might have missed out the more than two grammatical or spelling mistakes which had resulted in knocking down my grade from a 'good' to a 'fair' .... <br/><br/>The rejections occur for edits I've graded throughout the range of 'good'  to 'poor'. <br/><br/>Anyone else faces problems with rejections of the majority of his / her grade edit tasks? <br/><br/>Edit : In the interim Cloudcrowd did say that the grades given by different graders for the same piece of edit don't have to match exactly but be close enough to one another in order for the graders' grades to be accepted. <br/><br/>In this case for the graders out there may I suggest that if in doubt we choose the grades that are in the &quot;middle&quot; where it's more likely that our own grades would agree with the other graders' grades than grades at the extreme ends unless the extreme grades are obviously well warranted?  <br/><br/>In practice I haven't seen anything that's &quot;excellent&quot; so I guess this is a grade that we can ignore. Also &quot;poor&quot; is a grade for obvious garbage.  That leaves &quot;good&quot;, &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;. I guess there's a fairly clear distinction between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; so if everyone chooses &quot;fair&quot; for those edits which they can't decide should go into &quot;weak/fair&quot; or &quot;good/fair&quot; then the chances of agreeing with other graders within one grade would be greater.  <hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by u0402215 on Oct 6, 2009, 9:11pm<br/><br/>Hey Cloudcrowd - do you think you can get the requestors to put up some examples of edits of reasonably badly-written sites that they'd grade as 'excellent', 'good', 'fair' and 'weak' somewhere to serve as a common reference for all of us dong the gradings somewhere? <br/><br/>Maybe this might help ameliorate the problem of different graders having different standards somewhat.  <hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by kaine23 on Oct 7, 2009, 9:01am<br/><br/>I'm getting more rejections today then I have when I started this.

Now, the re-writes are back up to $1.50 a pop.  I figure if I can shell out the money to get a speech to text recognition software, I could probably re-write web pages in less than 5 minutes.

This was a review of a rewrite of a Taiwanese web site. The Rewriter simply copied and pasted in the existing site. Another reviewer, with high credibility gave this a rejection grade of &quot;weak&quot;. Melissa gave it a good. This may have happend if Melissa was confused between the base state of the existing site, and the degree of improvement. The existing site is definitely not badly written, although it could use some improvement. Melissa was rejected and given a poor grade on this task, which is what we'd consider a correct result.<br/><br/>2.  Melissa rated something fair. It was rated good by a high credibility person, and Melissa ended up with a grade of fair for her review. She just missed, therefore, being accepted.  As a result of our review over the past two days, we have lowered the threshold on this project.  Melissa's result would be accepted in the future and we will make sure she gets credit for this answer.<br/><br/>Regarding the &quot;instant&quot; rejection:  Unlike MTurk where you may have to wait days for an approval, CloudCrowd is designed to give approvals (or rejections) as soon as there has been enough review to grade an answer.   This should help to significantly reduce the problem people face on MTurk where they do hundreds of HITS only to get them all rejected.<br/><br/>Cut and Paste Jobs:  We'll be redesigning this project slightly to minimize the number of cut and pastes that make it to the Grade Written Text review tasks.<br/><br/>Appeals:  We're implementing an Appeal button in an upcoming release which will allow you to easily request review on a number of rejected tasks.<br/><br/>Examples:  We will be posting a link in the instructions shortly to an examples page with samples of answers that meet each grading level. <br/><br/>Please keep the feedback coming. <br/><br/><br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by kaine23 on Oct 7, 2009, 2:49pm<br/><br/>Could my $1.50 &quot;edit badly-worded paragraphs&quot; approved and marked as $1.25 problem be addressed please.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by cloudcrowd on Oct 7, 2009, 4:24pm<br/><br/>Kaine-<br/><br/>Sorry for the confusion.

I did a project today where there was just one large paragraph of text, very poorly written and made it into five smaller paragraphs.  I was graded as having done a &quot;fair&quot; job and will not be paid for this work.<br/><br/>My question is this-should we just skip web sites with smaller amounts of poorly written text and go to the next web page or should we try to modify the text to make it readable?<br/><br/>I would like to know why I was given a &quot;fair&quot; rating so if the reviewers would have a place to explain their rating, that would ease my mind.

We are not just shaving prices to try to save a penny here or there.  We're adjusting prices along with the number of reviewers.<br/><br/>This will have two positive benefits for people doing work:<br/><br/>1. More reviewers means higher accuracy, and less chance that your work will be incorrectly rejected.<br/><br/>2.  More reviewers means more work in the system.

These are good examples of what to look for when doing a rewrite, and how to score one.<br/><br/>Qista Industry Group CO., LTD is one of the leading factories which develops and produces consumer electronics products in China. Qista Industry Group CO., LTD is supported by the Chinese government *as one of the most importantly developed company*. All of the models are produced by *machine* automatically. Qista Industry Group CO has a Research and Development Center in Taiwan which possesses the most advanced *patent* for electronic R&D *technique* which is the reason we are among the best in China.<br/><br/>*Qista, care you feel at any time!*<br/><br/>-----<br/>User Notes: I gave this a 'weak' because of the last sentence which is clearly ungrammatical, and I'm fairly certain that there should be an 's' behind the word 'technique' in asterisks. My personal preference is also to put the words 'machine' and 'patent' in asterisks above in their plural forms though on the other hand I guess it's also acceptable to leave them as they are.<br/>___<br/><br/>Mark's Notes: I agree this is a weak. The reasons you gave would at least make it a fair. I also called out the phrase, &quot;as one of the most importantly developed company&quot; , which has two problems, &quot;importantly developed&quot; and the singular of &quot;company&quot;.<br/><br/>Note that if you'd rated this a fair and it was judged a weak, you'd still get credit.<br/><br/>Here's the next one:<br/><br/>For over five years, Bond Telecom Company has specialized in producing and marketing wireless communication equipment and electronics such as long range cordless phones, transceivers, mobile phones and solar products.<br/><br/>Our products have obtained high popularity in our main markets: Indonesia, Thailand, Honduras, Paraguay, Ghana, Chile, India, and Pakistan.<br/><br/>We can supply OEM and ODM services; Bond Telecom Company can offer you the best service, from A to Z.<br/><br/>A bright future belongs to us, let's experience it together!<br/><br/>User Notes: I didn't actually submit this one because on the one hand there isn't anything that's obviously wrong grammar or spelling wise, which might have justified someone giving a 'good', but on the other hand the sentences are rather awkwardly phrased and for this reason someone would also be justified giving a 'weak' or 'fair' grading. I'm more inclined towards giving it a 'fair' grading.<br/><br/><br/>Mark's Notes: I agree with your &quot;fair&quot;. A weak would have more serious grammar or spelling issues and it's too clunky to be a &quot;good&quot;.<br/><br/>The last one:<br/><br/>Cixi V-MART Electric Tech. Co., Ltd. is a professional manufacturer for small home appliances, integrating product development, molding and assembling together. Hangzhou Bay Bridge links Ningbo * (Where the factory is located)* and Shanghai, *which is the longest cross-sea bridge in the world*, providing a transport shortcut to international container terminals. Established in 2005, within a modernized industrial zone covering 20,000 square meters, we now have the most advanced injection &lt;machine&gt;, processing machines, production lines and inspection &lt;system&gt;. ...<br/><br/>User Notes: If not for the parts in asterisks I'd have graded the submission as 'good' ; however there's an erroneous capital 'W' in the asterisked sentence &quot;(Where the factory is located)&quot;. Also, there's a logical error in the phrase &quot;Shanghai, which is the longest .. bridge&quot; which seems to suggest that Shanghai is a bridge; in fact Shanghai is a city but I think the writer is trying to refer to the Hangzhou Bay Bridge.<br/><br/>For these two errors I'd have graded an edit which I'd otherwise have graded as a 'good' as 'fair'. <br/><br/><br/>Mark's Notes: I'd give this a fair as well for the same reasons you did. I also added a few highlights with &lt; &gt; marks.<br/><br/>These are a tougher call, because we don't know if they have more than one injection machine or inspection system. The problem is that if you leave some plural and some singular it makes the singular look incorrect.  I'd lean towards using the plural.<br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by kaine23 on Oct 9, 2009, 5:08pm<br/><br/>You know, doing these now have been pointing out all the spelling and grammar issues in my head when I'm looking at ebay auctions from China, Japan, or Taiwan.

Do these payments need to be claimed for tax purposes?<br/>A.Yes. Also note that the Federal government requires us to send you a 1099 once you've earned $600 in one year.<br/><br/>Q.  [For editing tasks ] Does your edit automatically get paid or is it only if it's reviewed and accepted? I just submitted a paragraph.  And do we have to insert the whole entire paragraph and then edit it, or just insert the part that's being edited?<br/><br/>A.  Rewrite/Edit tasks must be reviewed and accepted to get paid.  You must rewrite the first five paragraphs or the first 80 words if there are less than five paragraphs.   If there are less than 80 words, hit �skip� and do not do the task.  <br/><br/>Q.  Should you use your &quot;real&quot; facebook page, or set up a special one for this?<br/>A.  We recommend that you use your real Facebook page. Creating extra pages actually violates the Facebook rules. <br/><br/>Q.  I was hoping the tasks would expand as well it would be nice to have more options too.  <br/>A.  Our goal is to have thousands of projects to choose from, but we're just starting out and it will take time to line up the work. We will be adding new projects and tasks regularly, so keep checking back.  The official CloudCrowd blog and forum will be up soon as well, and will be the first place to learn about new work on our system.  We�ll post a note here with a link.  <br/><br/>Q.  Can you tell me why my recent submission was rejected? <br/>A.   Rejections can happen for a number of reasons.  The most common reason for rewrites to be rejected is that the work is simply not polished enough to earn an acceptable grade.  It�s not enough to just fix spelling and grammar errors�your job is to make the copy into standard business English. <br/>Rewrites less than 80 words are also rejected.  If you are doing rewrites you might want to do them in a word processor first and then paste them into the answer box on CloudCrowd.   This will help you to spell check and get a quick word count.  <br/>You may also want to post some of your rewrites along with the grade you received on your favorite forum and ask for feedback.  <br/><br/>Q.   Do I need to read the original site content when doing a �Grade Written Text� review or can I just rate the quality of the work I see?<br/>A.  You MUST go to the original site for Grade Written Text reviews.  Part of this task is to ensure that the copy was not just cut and pasted directly from the original site.  There is no way to tell how much improvement was made to the copy without visiting the original site. <br/>Note:  You may have to check several places on the original site to find the correct copy.  Check links that say, �English�, �About�, �Company� or �Profile�.<br/><br/>Q.  Some of the re-writes I looked at are just awful. Typos, transpositions, grammatical errors, punctuation problems, sentence fragments, etc.   I can do much better than this.  Should I try some rewrites?<br/>A.  The bad re-writes you are seeing are largely coming from people who are ignoring the instructions and trying to earn credit by simply cutting and pasting the original text, or making just a few changes.  People who submit garbage answers are very quickly suspended from using CloudCrowd.<br/> If you notice a lot of errors when grading re-writes, you may be a good editor/rewriter.    Our suggestion is to try one or two first to see how you are graded.  Once you are comfortable that your work will be accepted you can submit more rewrites.    <br/><br/>Q.   I did three rewrites tonight. Even you said you were paying $1.50, I got $1.50 for one of them and $1.25 for the other two.  What happened?<br/>A.  Prices on CloudCrowd work a little like the stock market. On any given day, different tasks might be undergoing price increases or price decreases. The core rule is this: the price that is in effect when you start work on an individual task (we call that &quot;task checkout&quot; is the price you're paid when that task is approved. If you do a bunch of tasks in a given project, and that project happens to be undergoing a lot of market price fluctuations, you might get paid different amounts for each task. We'll be adding some extra notification to bring to your attention price reductions. For now, check the price frequently. Prices rarely change more than once per day, however.<br/><br/>Q.  Is it just me or have the prices changed? Once you have a large workforce will you dramatically drop the pay for each task?<br/>A.  CloudCrowd works on the principle that if the price is too low, quality workers won't work on the tasks.  No matter how large our workforce gets, if we are not paying a fair rate for work, people simply won�t do it, or we won�t get the quality we need.   <br/>Task prices can change daily based on how much work we need done for a given project that day, and how many reviewers we need for a particular task. Our goal is to balance what we pay with what it costs us to operate, and what our clients are willing to pay for quality, finished work.    <br/><br/>Q.  Should I create a separate Paypal account just for CloudCrowd payments?<br/>A.   It�s up to you.  CloudCrowd has no access to any of your PayPal account information.  Just like anyone who has been given your PayPal email address, we can send you money but that's all we can do.<br/><br/>Q.  When you search for poorly written websites and it asks you to submit the website and a contact email, it means the contact email of the website, right? Not my email, right?<br/>A.  Yes.  When you enter an email address as part of a task the address we�re asking for is the contact address for the person or site referred to in the task, and will never be your personal email address.<br/><br/>Q. My rejected task was from grading a rewrite. I followed the instructions on grading it. There was bad grammar and five words misspelled so I rated it based on that.  Why was I rejected?<br/>A. Your work is reviewed by other workers.  You will occasionally have work rejected even if it is correct.  This will happen less frequently as we continue to fine-tune our systems and as we gain better information about the credibility of each worker. Also, we will be adding an &quot;Appeal&quot; process that allows you to appeal certain rejections.  <br/><br/>Q. I joined last night and worked on some last night and just now...when do you put in the payment? <br/>A.  We are on Pacific Time.   Payments for work done one day will be made the next day before midnight, Pacific Time. At the moment, we're managing to pay a lot of people &quot;same day&quot; but we don't promise payment until the next day.<br/><br/>Q. Can someone tell me about the credibility rating? Is it the higher the number the better, or what? What's a good rating?<br/>A. Credibility ratings can be anywhere from 1 to 100.  The higher the number, the better.   If your credibility score drops below a certain point you�ll receive a probation notice, and if your score drops again after receiving the notice you�ll be suspended.  If you are doing quality work your score should continue to rise.   <br/><br/>Q. Has anyone else noticed that they got paid, but the money they were paid still shows on the &quot;amount awaiting payment&quot; portion of their info?<br/>A.  This is a temporary glitch.  We�re addressing it and it should not be an ongoing issue.<br/><br/>Q.  My concern is that there are lot of people joining this program. Do you have enough work for everybody?<br/>A.   Frankly, at the moment, no. We're getting incredible response from interested workers, but only have four projects to offer them. This is in part because we're new, and in part because of a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem: When we go to a business and say &quot;give us some work for our Crowd to work on&quot;, they have been saying &quot;show me that you have a Crowd that can do good work&quot;.<br/><br/>The good news is that since we launched at the beginning of October, we have been rapidly building our OWN credibility, and this will make it easier to get new work into the system. Note this important fact: we also have a referral program for people who refer business clients (sources of work) to us. You can make a lot of money if you know a company big or small that needs some serious assistance from the CloudCrowd. <br/> <br/>Meanwhile, we do have a number of new projects that we�re close to posting.  As more people learn about working with CloudCrowd, more people will also learn that they can get work done through CloudCrowd.   <br/><br/>Q.  I love your Personal Crowd referral program. Do you have a similar referral program for people who refer companies to you that need work done?<br/><br/>A.  Yes.  We have a business referral program.  If you know a company that could use our services, get in touch with us via the Contact link at the bottom left of the CloudCrowd application on Facebook, or through the Contact link on our website at <a href="http://www.cloudcrowd.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.cloudcrowd.com</a><br/><br/>Q.  Has anybody else noticed if something gets rejected, you still get paid? One of my re-writes got rejected and I still got paid for it.<br/>A. This is a bug. Rejected tasks shown in your Work History have been showing their price, even though you aren't actually credited for it. This will be fixed soon. <br/><br/>Q. Can someone explain to me how CloudCrowd makes money? <br/>A. We make money by finding companies that need large projects completed  and matching them with workers that can get the job done quickly and accurately.   Businesses pay us to create a turn-key solution-- we manage everything from designing the projects to delivering the finished results.<br/><br/>Q.  I started mid-morning yesterday and I have not been paid yet.  What happened?<br/>A. The first thing to do is to look at your Work History.  If you have tasks that were approved as of yesterday and you have still not been paid, the second step is to check your PayPal account information in your CloudCrowd profile.  Go to �Home� and then �Personal Details� to find it.  If you don�t have a PayPal account, you�ll need to set up a free account at <a href="http://www.paypal.com." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.paypal.com.</a><br/>If you have a correct PayPal account and have not been paid within 24 hours of submitting a task, there are really only four possibilities:<br/><br/>1)The task was rejected by its reviewers<br/><br/>2) Your account was suspended because a rule was broken (you <br/>would have been told about this)<br/><br/>3) Your task is Awaiting Review. Sometimes, when the reviewers can't come to a conclusion, it takes extra time to get the issue resolved. We route some such tasks to special queues for internal staff to review, and sometimes, frankly, we get a little behind.<br/><br/>4) We screwed up, and you should file a support request.<br/>So, if the task shows Awaiting Review, you just need to hang in there, although, if it stays like this for more than 2 days, please report it to us.<br/><br/>If the task shows Rejected, you're not going to paid for it.<br/>If the task shows Approved, and it's more than 24 hours since you submitted it, let us know about it, and we'll figure out what's wrong.<br/><br/>Q.  I honestly feel quite frustrated. When I edit badly written sites, for some reason when I click submit a notice comes up on the app saying that my internet connection isn't functioning, and to try again in a few minutes. My internet connection has been working perfectly, and before I even get the chance to wait a few minutes in order to resubmit, the page changes immediately and I lose my work! This has happened 2 times for me, and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing these rewrites that don't even get submitted. It's also practically impossible to have that particular site show up again, which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>A.   We'd like to investigate this and similar issues. Please submit a bug report by clicking on the Contact link near the bottom left hand corner when you are logged into CloudCrowd.  In the meantime, make sure you don�t have multiple Facebook logins open at the same time.  It may also help to close and restart your browser.<br/><br/>Q.  Is it me, or have a lot of the rewrites had no text to rewrite (no about us or company profile) or are in all Chinese (no English version)?<br/>A. Sometimes you might have to look for a button on the page that says &quot;English�.  That should take you to the correct text.<br/><br/>Q.  I see they took my favorite task off, will it come back?<br/>A.  The answer is a definitive �maybe�.  We take some tasks down when rewriting the instructions or making other changes.  Those tasks will come back when the changes have been made.  Over the long run you�ll find that most projects will be up for a while, and will then be completed.   <br/><br/>Q   A data entry or transcribing job up there would be nice. Hint, hint CloudCrowd. <br/>A.  We have a data entry job scheduled to go up shortly.  Keep checking back, as we�ll add new projects and tasks regularly.<br/><br/>Q.   What an interesting name. I wonder what made them choose it?<br/>A.   We chose our name because we combine the idea behind �cloud� computing, where companies use the internet to tap networks of powerful computers and software outside their own offices, with a term called �Crowdsourcing�, where companies get work done by people like you who work when they want, where they want.   Put the two ideas together, and you get CloudCrowd.<br/><br/>Q.  Can Canadians sign up for this? If so, can a Canadian send me a referral code? <br/>A.  There are not currently any geographic restrictions on who can work at CloudCrowd.   You can sign up with any referral code.<br/><br/>Q.  How long does it take to approve �Edit Badly-Written English Paragraphs� tasks?<br/>A.  It depends on how many workers are currently reviewing these submissions and whether our system agrees with the grade the reviewers give.   If the system doesn�t agree with the reviewers, the work is sent to a separate higher level review, which can take additional time.<br/><br/>Q.  For the re-write website project do I have to completely re-write the copy to earn credit?<br/>A.  It's not about totally rewriting it so much as it's about correcting, improving, and polishing it.  The end result should read like copy you�d see on the website of a major U.S. company.<br/><br/>Q. How long does it take PayPal to pay you once you have money in your PayPal account?<br/>A.  The easiest way to get money quickly from PayPal is to request a free ATM/Debit card from them.  You can use this to pay for things just like you would a regular debit card, and the money comes right out of your PayPal account.  You can also withdraw money at most ATMs.<br/><br/>If you don�t have a PayPal debit card, you need to request that PayPal transfer funds from your PayPal account to your bank account.  According to PayPal this takes 3-4 business days.<br/><br/>Q.  I'm hoping that a lot of things mentioned on here, (i.e. poor ratings being rejected, pay being updated as they pay us, etc.) will be getting fixed.<br/>A.  We are reading and responding to the questions as quickly as we can, and we�re constantly making changes to improve the system.  You may noticed the word �Beta� after our name in the CloudCrowd application on Facebook.  Beta means that while we�re open for business we are still fine-tuning everything.  Your feedback while we are in Beta is very much appreciated.

It looks like there's been a flood of new workers.<br/><br/>I'm concerned, actually, about the FB platform.  People there are used to playing games and chatting with friends and may not take this work seriously.  Already you can see the results of people scamming the system, particularly with all of the cut-and-paste jobs that are happening with the edits.  This really infuriates me, because the scammers on mTurk have helped drive away credible requesters.  People here openly boasted about turbo-Turking, and one, I recall, hooked up a game controller and was whizzing through the Amazon Requester HITS.  Is it any wonder that these HITS now arbitrarily and frequently reject the work?  They have to, or people would start gaming them again.<br/><br/>I like CloudCrowd a lot.  The interface is fantastic, the tasks are interesting, and they pay daily.  I'd hate to see the scammers ruin a good thing for everyone.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by goobygirl on Oct 11, 2009, 2:35pm<br/><br/>I too got my account disabled with no mention of the alleged &quot;rule&quot; broken.

You have not complied with your own Terms of Service which was that you would give a warning before disabling an account. I think the fair thing to do is to assume that since I had a high credibility rating (prior to your other bug) that this is another error or error, and not due to my intentional act. <br/><br/>Further, it seems to me your Beta test should also have something that puts the burden on the system to weed out fake rewrites versus putting the burden on a human who can make a human error.   I stopped doing a lot of the grading other work tasks after the aforementioned bug in the Grade Rewrite section plummeted my credibility rating since it didn't seem like a good risk to take.<br/><br/>I have taken the time to recommend CloudCrowd to many of my friends. I would not like my credibility rating with them to plummet simply because you did not abide by your own TOS and have acted unfairly toward me. I will have to tell them about this an risk a hit to my reputation as well.

Three of the four were clearly wrong and awarded &quot;excellent&quot; grades to work that was clearly sub-par.

There is a discussion board on CloudCrowd-you have to go to the bottom of your Facebook account, find the blue CloudCrowd link and from there, you can see the discussions on these very issues.<br/><br/>I guess I keep looking for a normal 8-4 job and that hasn't panned out for me so I'm curious and intrigued by the crowd sourcing options.  I'm still willing to give the application a bit more of my time since I do get paid every day from them in my PayPal account.

We could write that web page and get the advertising dollars for collecting the information.  <br/><br/>I've certainly found out a lot more about Crowdsourcing by doing all this online research on my own, why not compile this research and make money by being the best reputable source for the Crowdsourcing industry?  I mean, the Volition board started up by Ray Solo has been around since 1995 (judging by their copyright information).<br/><br/>Any rate, people do &quot;pay&quot; for information, whether they pay for it by searching the internet for countless hours or by viewing mindless advertising.  <br/><br/>Would it be possible to set up a Crowdsourcing bulletin board---of course, it would have to be moderated to keep out the unscrupulous.  Making money off the advertising dollars, not having people pay to get the information.  <br/><br/>I write this all before doing a google search to see if there even is a Crowdsourcing bulletin board.  Guess I'd better start googling!<hr size="1"/><b>Re: CloudCrowd: New Alternative to Mechanical Turk</b><br/>Post by mooncalled on Feb 1, 2010, 1:01am<br/><br/>If anyone is interested, these guys now have some question & answer tasks up.

They have a certain way of making good, honest workers feel like crap. Count your blessings that they cut you loose so soon, at least you hadn't invested too much time and effort on them. <hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cloud crowd</b><br/>Post by me on Jul 19, 2010, 9:29pm<br/><br/>I check them out from time to time.  They normally only have a handful of jobs up at any given time, and most of them require a credential to do.  I'm probably missing it completely, but I can't figure out how to take the dang credential tests.  <br/><br/>In fact, there is one job on there right now actually called a credential test, but when you click on it to &quot;take&quot; it, it says you have to have the credential.  LOL, so you have to have a credential to take a test for the credential you have to have to take the test.  Figure that one out.<br/><br/>Also, I think I did about 24 penny HITs last night.  Eight of them were rejected.  Hmm, that's odd, considering I don't even get 8 rejections a month on Mturk, and I do thousands of hits a month.<br/><br/>To put it simply, their system sucks....bad.  The only good thing about them is that they pay via Paypal within a day.

Again, I'm going to say I'm new to all of this stuff and have only been using Mturk for a few days.<br/><br/>I've heard recently that there are other sites such as Cloudcrowd and stuff that do a similar thing as Mturk, using a virtual workforce (us) to help with tasks and stuff by requesters.<br/><br/>Does anyone know if any other sites like this are any good? Do they pay well? Is there a better requester/payment system/HITs in place on other sites?<br/><br/>If anyone knows, thanks... I'm just curious as to what else is out there, but I don't want to join up with a bunch of different sites, so if you've got any experience with them, please share  <img src="http://s2.images.proboards.com/smiley.gif" alt=":)" border="0"/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cloudcrowd (and other things similar to Mturk?</b><br/>Post by araenel on Aug 16, 2010, 2:43pm<br/><br/>Cloudcrowd is the same company as the requester Dolores Labs...

I thought it had a lot of promise at first, but it just hasn't panned out as far as I'm concerned.  A lot of their tasks are reviewed and approved by workers, and I can't tell you how many times I've had tasks wrongly rejected.  They do have an appeal process, but it feels silly to appeal a wrongly rejected task when it's only worth a penny or two.  However, I've had my credibility rating go from 96 down to 23 with only one or two answers wrongly reviewed and marked as wrong.  <br/><br/>The other thing I hate about Cloudcrowd is they expect you to do a lot of work for no pay at all, not even a crumby penny.  For example, one task was to go to a website and find a contact email.  If you didn't find an email, you were told to skip the task.  Unfortunately, you might have to open up 10 websites before you found one with an email address listed.  And then if you did find a website with an email,  you submitted it and finally got a the penny for the work.  But not if someone reviewing the task erroneously said you didn't provide an email for the task.  Then you get nothing and your credibility rating plummets.  And even if you appeal for the penny (which I did once just to see what happens), you get the penny, but your credibility rating is still so bad that you basically can't do any more tasks.<br/><br/>So after months of testing it for several different tasks, I can't recommend Cloudcrowd.  I make much more money on Mturk, even with all of the sketchy requesters. <br/><br/>Hope this helps.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cloudcrowd (and other things similar to Mturk?</b><br/>Post by pikachulovely on Aug 16, 2010, 11:08pm<br/><br/>That does help a lot... it sounds like CloudCrowd's system isn't doing their job anywhere near as well as it should, and doesn't sound as good as Mturk.<br/><br/>Thank you VERY much for that summary  <img src="http://s2.images.proboards.com/smiley.gif" alt=":)" border="0"/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cloudcrowd (and other things similar to Mturk?</b><br/>Post by fifthm on Aug 17, 2010, 11:21am<br/><br/>Wow.
