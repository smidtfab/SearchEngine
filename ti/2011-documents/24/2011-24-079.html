					<p>The living lab has emerged in parallel with <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/">ambient intelligence</a> research community context and the discussion of the experience and application research (AER). The appearance of the term is based on the concept of <a href="http://www.upassoc.org/upa_publications/user_experience/">user experience</a> and ambient intelligence (AmI). William Mitchell said a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/innovation-2">living laboratory</a> is a research methodology focused on the user to detect, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. Today, several living laboratory descriptions and definitions are available from different sources. Recently Mitchell, along with Kent Larson and Sandy Pentland, formed the first US-based consortium living research laboratories. According to the website Consortium: The convergence of globalization, demographic changes and urbanization is transforming nearly every aspect of our lives. We face new choices about where and how they work, live, travel, communicate, and maintain health. Ultimately, our societies are being transformed. Living Labs at MIT brings together interdisciplinary experts to develop, implement and test &#8211; in real conditions of life &#8211; new technologies and design strategies that respond to this changing world. Our work extends to the scale of urban staff and address the challenges related to health, energy and creativity. However, the term &#8220;living laboratory&#8221; or &#8220;living laboratory&#8221; is also used for the representation of a residential home to research where the behavior of people living in this house notes and patterns of use are collected by researchers which are investigating ways to combine new technologies with user-centered design. In this kind of living laboratory, the users are the most observed subjects participating in the co-creation of ideas and scenarios in advance. There are examples of research facilities, such as PlaceLab ExperienceLab at MIT and Philips Research. The living laboratory process, which integrates both user-centric research and open innovation is based on a spiral of maturity at the same time the involvement of a multidisciplinary team in the four main activities: * Co-creation: bring together technology push and application of traction (ie, crowdsourcing, crowdcasting) in a variety of views, constraints and knowledge sharing that supports the ideation of new scenarios, concepts and related objects. * Exploration: involve all stakeholders, especially communities of users, in the previous phase of co-creation process to discover new locations, habits and behaviors through scenarios live in real or virtual environments (eg virtual reality augmented reality, mixed reality). * Experimentation: apply the appropriate level of technological devices to experience live scenarios with a large number of users, while collecting data that will be analyzed in its context in assessment activity. * Rating: evaluate new ideas and innovative concepts and technological artifacts related to real life situations through various dimensions such as ergonomics and social, socio-cognitive and socio-economic, comment on the potential for viral adoption new concepts and technological devices linked through a confrontation with value patterns of users. A concept is a living laboratory for research.</p>
<p>A living laboratory is a user-centered, open-innovation ecosystem, often operate in a territorial context (eg, city, metropolitan, region) integration of concurrent research and innovation processes within an association public-private partnership between the peoples. The concept is based on a systematic user co-creation approach of integrating the processes of research and innovation. These are integrated through exploration, experimentation and evaluation of innovative ideas, scenarios, concepts and artifacts related technology in real life cases. These cases involve the use of user communities, not only as subjects observed, but also as a source of creation. This approach allows [who?] To assess simultaneously both the overall performance of a product or service and its possible adoption by users. This consideration can be done in the previous phase of research and development and through all elements of product life cycle, from design to recycling. See also: concurrent engineering user centered research methods such as action research, community computing, contextual design, the user-centered design, participatory design, empathic design, emotional design, and other usability methods that already exist but not enough power to users for cooperation, the creation of open development environments. More recently, Web 2.0 has demonstrated the positive impact of user communities to participate in new product development (NPD), such as mass collaboration projects (eg Wikipedia, crowdsourcing, wisdom of crowds) in the form collective creation of new content and applications. A laboratory of life is similar to a test as its philosophy is to make users, subjects traditionally considered to be observed for testing modules to the requirements in the creation of value to contribute to the co-creation and exploration of new ideas, advanced scenarios, innovative concepts and related objects. Therefore, a laboratory of life and not an experimental environment, which could be compared with the concept of experiential learning, where users are immersed in a social space for creative design and experience their own future. laboratories of life can also be used by policy makers and users / citizens to design, explore, experiment and refine new policies and regulations in the real-life scenarios to assess potential impacts prior to implementation. Although the idea and discussion about some of the consequences (especially the cooperation between firms in R &amp; D) date back at least until the 60&#8242;s, open innovation is a term promoted by Henry Chesbrough, a professor and executive director of the Center for Open Innovation at the University of Berkeley, in his book Open Innovation:</p>
<p>The New Imperative for the creation and use of technology. The concept is related to user innovation, cumulative innovation, know-how trading, innovation and innovation in distributed mass. &#8220;Open innovation is a paradigm that assumes firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as companies seek to advance their technology.&#8221; The boundaries between a company and its environment have become more permeable, innovations can be easily transferred in and out. The central idea behind open innovation is that in a world of widely distributed knowledge, companies can not afford to rely entirely on their own research, but must buy or license processes or inventions (patents) from other companies. In addition, internal inventions not being used in the business of a company should be removed from the company (for example, through licensing, joint ventures, spin-offs). The closed innovation paradigm, says that successful innovation requires control. A company must control (generation of) their own ideas, as well as production, marketing, distribution, financing services, and support. The main cause behind this idea is that at the beginning of the twentieth century, universities and government were not involved in the commercial application of science. Some companies therefore decided to do everything themselves. They created their own research and development (R &amp; D) departments to control the entire new product development (NPD) cycle within the company. It just was not time to wait for the scientific community to participate more in the practical application of science. Also there was insufficient time to wait for other companies to start producing some of the components required in the final product. These companies became relatively self-sufficient &#8220;castle&#8221;, with little communication directed outwards to other companies or universities. Over the years there were several factors that paved the way for open innovation paradigm: * The increasing availability and mobility of skilled workers * The growth of venture capital market * external options for ideas sitting on the platform * The increasing ability of external suppliers These four factors have led to a new market knowledge . Knowledge is not already owned by the company. Resides on employees, suppliers, customers, competitors and universities. If companies do not use the knowledge we have inside, someone else will. Innovation can be generated either through or closed innovation to open innovation paradigm. There is an ongoing debate about which of the two paradigms dominate in the future. Open source versus open innovation while open source and open innovation, could come into conflict over patent issues, are not mutually exclusive, as participating companies can donate their patents to an independent organization, put them in a common fund or grant an unlimited license to anyone. Therefore some of the open source initiatives can combine the two concepts, as is the case for example of IBM IBM Eclipse platform is to defend a case of open innovation, where firms compete are invited to cooperate within open innovation network. In 1997, Eric Raymond, writing about the movement of open source software, coined the term &#8216;Cathedral and the Bazaar. &#8221; The cathedral is the conventional method of using a group of experts for the design and development of software (although it could be applied to any large scale work creative or innovative). The bazaar is the open source approach. This idea has been extended by a lot of people, including Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams in his book Wikinomics. Eric Raymond himself is also quoted as saying that &#8216;no land can encode in the bazaar.</p>
<p>You can test, debug and improve in bazaar style, but it would be very difficult to lead a project in bazaar mode. In the same vein, Raymond is also quoted as saying, &#8220;The individual wizard is that successful projects usually start bazaar. Open Source specialist François Letellier advocates that open source (or free software) is a natural way of innovation in the software industry and is a very effective way of example and open innovation &#8211; as open source projects / act communities as innovation intermediaries. Examples * NineSigma Open Innovation, was initiated in 2000 by Professor Dr. Mehran Mehregany, Goodrich Professor of Engineering Innovation at Case Western University. NineSigma was the first provider of open innovation services company helping clients develop and maximize the value of their innovation programs. In 2008, NineSigma is between 20 per cent of companies in the Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing companies in the United States private. The company also has operations in Europe and Asia. * InnoCentive began in 2001, crowdsourced research and development of biomedical and pharmaceutical companies, including companies in other industries. InnoCentive offers free services and relationship management between the finders and solvers. &#8221; Applicants are companies looking for solutions to critical problems. Resolve the 185,000 registered members of the crowd of InnoCentive to offer their solutions to the search engines. Solvers whose solutions are selected by the search engines are compensated for their ideas through InnoCentive, which acts as an intermediary in the process. InnoCentive recently partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation to target the mob solutions InnoCentive Solver for orphan diseases and other social philanthropy. * Innovation Exchange is a provider of open innovation, which emphasizes the diversity of the community, but solutions to business problems of sources of expert and novice. Sponsor companies meet the challenges by individuals, people who work in ad hoc teams, or small and medium enterprises. Unlike sites focused on innovation in the physical sciences, the Exchange fosters product innovation, service, process and business model innovation. * Brightidea, founded in 1999, is a provider of management software for social innovation. The technology has been used by companies and government institutions to communities the power of open innovation and competition. Examples include the year 2010 General Electric Ecomagination Challenge seeking new network technologies for next-generation, and the first of Cisco iPrize competition in 2007 and his first challenge iPrize Russia in 2010. * Spigit, founded in 2007, is a provider of innovative tools that provides a platform that can be used to create open communities to capture, evaluate and help select ideas for implementation. Some examples of organizations that sponsor the use Spigit are private organizations or enterprises to extend the idea to the customer community members or government agencies creating open communities to capture the ideas of citizens. * PRESANS, a startup of the Ecole Polytechnique in France, founded in 2009, developed and implemented the dynamics of several stages of Experts Supply (MDES) approach. It is based on a combination of web-mining technology of prior art and secure multi-step problem solving process. In this approach, the experts are not recorded, however, individual digital tracks left on the web to detect and invite them to the letter to address more challenging technological problems. MDES has great advantages for the platform for experts and corporate clients. User innovation refers to innovation by downstream users (eg business users) or users of consumers (individual end users or user groups), rather than by the suppliers (producers or manufacturers) (Rogers et al. 2010 .) Eric von Hippel (von Hippel, 1986) of MIT and others noted that many products and services are actually developed or refined at least, by users at the site of application and use. These ideas are then moved back into the grid and learn <a href="http://theticketsguide.com">how to become a ticket broker</a>. This is because the products are developed to meet the widest possible the need, when individual users face problems that most consumers do not have no choice but to develop their own modifications to existing products or completely new products to solve their problems. Often, users <a href="http://backpackingthrougheurope.net/">backpacking Europe</a> share their innovative ideas with manufacturers with the hope that their production of the product, a process called free revealing. Based on research on the evolution of Internet technologies and open <a href="http://backpackingthrougheurope.net/ten-amazing-places-to-visit-in-london/">places to visit in London</a> source software Ilkka Tuomi (Tuomi 2002) also stressed the point that users are mainly social. user innovation, therefore, it is also social and distributed socio-technical innovation.</p>
<p>According to Tuomi, use the key is often used unwanted invented by user communities that reinterpret and reinvent the meaning of new technological opportunities. The existence of user innovation, or example, users of industrial robots, rather than manufacturers of robots <a href="http://www.preis1.de/astragon-landwirtschafts-simulator-2011-pc.html">landwirtschafts simulator 2011</a> (Fleck, 1988) is an essential part of the argument against the linear model of innovation (Williams, 1996) ie innovation comes from research and development, is &#8220;spreading&#8221; then the marketing and end users. Instead innovation is a nonlinear process innovations in all phases Eric von Hippel in 1986 introduced the method of lead that can be used to systematically learn about user innovation in order to apply it in developing new products. User innovation has a number of levels: use innovation, innovation in services, innovation in technology settings, and finally, innovation of new technologies themselves. Although most user innovation focuses on the use and configuration of existing products and technologies, and is a normal part of long-term innovation, new technologies that are easier for end users to change and innovate, and new channels of communication are making it much easier for the user to produce innovation and impact. Recent <a href="http://www.southwestgreenhouses.co.uk/greenhouses-for-sale.html">greenhouses for sale</a> research has focused on Web-based forums to facilitate the user (or client) innovation &#8211; which refers to the environment as a virtual customer, these forums help partners with their clients at various stages of product development and other activities of value creation. For example, Threadless, a manufacture of the shirt is based on the contribution of members of the online community in the design process. The community includes a group of volunteer designers submit designs and vote on the designs of others. In addition to the free exhibition, designers are provided financial incentives including a base award of $ 2,500 and a percentage of sales of T-shirts. These incentives allow Threadless to encourage user contribution continues In computing, ambient intelligence (AmI) refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. Ambient intelligence is a vision of the future of consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing that was originally developed in the decade of 1990 to the time <a href="http://www.southwestgreenhouses.co.uk/leanto.html">lean to greenhouses</a> period 2010-2020. In an ambient intelligence world, devices work together <a href="http://www.freedatarecoverysoftwarehq.com/">free data recovery software</a> to support people in carrying out their daily life activities, tasks and rituals in an easy, natural using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices (see Internet of Things). As these devices grow smaller, more connected and more integrated into our environment, technology is lost in our surroundings until only the user interface remains perceivable by users. The paradigm of ambient intelligence <a href="http://www.flavorconnect.com/landing/">Online Dating</a> is based on ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous computing, profiling practices, and designing human-computer interaction-centric and is characterized <a href="http://www.temporarycarinsurancehq.com/">temporary car insurance</a> by systems and technologies that are (Zelkha and Epstein, 1998; Aarts, Hartwig and Schuurmans 2001): * embedded: many network devices are integrated into the environment * context-sensitive: these devices can <a href="http://www.smokepower.com/">electronic cigarette</a> recognize you and your situational context * Customized: can be tailored to your needs adjustment *: can <a href="http://www.idscanner.com/">ID Scanner</a> change in response to you * in advance: you can anticipate your desires without conscious mediation. Ambient intelligence is closely related to long-term vision of an intelligent service system in which technologies are capable of automating a platform for integration of devices needed to supply context aware services, user, adaptation and anticipation. A typical context of ambient intelligence environment is a home environment <a href="http://www.moderncollections.com/">modern furniture</a> (Bieliková and Krajcovic 2001). More and more people make decisions based on the effect their actions have on their inner world, mental. Thus the experience of acting driven by a change in the past when people are concerned mainly about the use value of products and services, and is the basis for the experience <a href="http://seo-consultant.shanehunter.org/">SEO Consultant</a> economy.</p>
<p>Ambient intelligence deals <a href="http://www.thedogtrainingclub.com/">Dog Training Tips</a> with this change in existential terms for people and an emphasis on user experience. The focus on user experience also grew to prominence in the 1990&#8242;s due to overloading of goods and services of the information society that were difficult to understand and difficult to use. A strong call came to design things <a href="http://www.einsured.co.uk">life insurance quotes</a> from the standpoint of the user. Ambient intelligence is influenced by user-centered design where the user is placed in the center of the design activity and asked to provide feedback through evaluations of specific users and try to improve the design or even co-create the design, along with the designer (participatory design) or other users (end-user development). For the AmI becomes reality requires a number of key technologies: * discrete hardware (miniaturization, nanotechnology <a href="http://www.get-him-back-forever.com/">get him back</a>, smart devices, sensors, etc) * seamless mobile / fixed communication and computing infrastructure <a href="http://www.electroniccigaretteburn.com/">electric cigarette</a> (Interoperability, wired and wireless networks, service-oriented architecture, semantic web, etc.) * Dynamic and massively distributed device networks, which are easy to (control and service discovery, for example, automatic configuration, the user end programmable devices and systems, etc.). * Human-centered computer interfaces (intelligent agents, multimodal interaction, awareness, context etc) * Reliable and secure systems and devices (self-testing and self repairing software, privacy <a href="http://bankruptcy.org.uk/iva">iva</a> ensuring technology, etc.) History In 1998, the Board of Directors Philips commissioned a series of internal presentations and workshops organized by Eli Zelkha and Brian Epstein, of Palo Alto <a href="http://www.debt-management.org">debt management</a> Ventures (who coined the name &#8220;Ambient Intelligence&#8221;) to investigate the different scenarios that would transform the industry high-volume consumer electronic the current &#8220;fragmented, with features&#8221; world in a world in 2020 where the devices support easy to use ubiquitous information communication and entertainment. In <a href="http://www.healthyhcg.com">hcg drops</a> subsequent years, this trend became more mature. In 1999, Philips joined the alliance of oxygen, an international consortium of industrial partners in the context of the MIT Oxygen project, which aims to develop computer technology for 21 century. In 2000, there were plans for a feasibility <a href="http://www.advanceloan.net">cash advance loans</a> study and ease of usability dedicated to Ambient Intelligence. This HomeLab officially opened April 24, 2002. Along with <a href="http://www.flavorconnect.com/">Dating Sites</a> the development of the vision of Philips, a series of parallel initiatives began to explore in more detail ambient intelligence. Following the advice of the Information Society and Technology <a href="http://www.thedogtrainingclub.com/labrador-training/">Labrador Training</a> Advisory Group (ISTAG), the European Commission used the vision for the launch of its Sixth Framework Programme (FP5) of the Information Society and Technology (CET) with a subsidiary budget of 3.7 million euros. The European Commission has played a crucial role in the development of <a href="http://seo-services.us">SEO</a> the AmI vision. As a result of numerous initiatives gained momentum AmI vision. In recent years several important initiatives have been launched. Fraunhofer Society started several activities in a variety of areas, including multimedia, microsystems design and increased space. MIT launched a research group of <a href="http://bankruptcy.org.uk/company-liquidation-administration">company liquidation</a> Ambient Intelligence in the Media Lab. A number of research projects started in a variety of countries like USA, Canada, Spain, France and the Netherlands. In 2004, the first European <a href="http://seo-services.us/services.php">SEO Services</a> Symposium on Ambient Intelligence (EUSAI) was carried out and many other conferences have been held to address special topics in the IAM. Example <a href="http://www.furniture-collection.co.uk/furniture/Oak-Furniture-Oak-Coffee-Tables/c24_48/index.html">coffee table</a> scenario Ellen returns home after a long day. At the main entrance which is recognized by an intelligent surveillance camera, the door alarm goes off, and <a href="http://www.healthyhcg.com/hcg.html">hcg diet</a> the door opens and opens. When she enters the room of the home page indicates that her husband <a href="http://www.lifelockreviews.org/">LifeLock reviews</a> Peter is at an art fair in Paris, and her daughter Charlotte is in the <a href="http://howtogetasixpack.tv/how-to-get-a-six-pack/">how to get a six pack</a> children&#8217;s playroom, where he is playing with an interactive whiteboard. The remote monitoring service <a href="http://www.dubturboreview.org/">Dub Turbo</a> is notified of children who are at home, and then the online connection is off. When she enters the kitchen lights note of the framework of the family to indicate that new messages. The shopping list has been composed needs confirmation before it is sent to the supermarket for delivery. There is also a message indicating that the source information <a href="http://www.phuket-info.com/forums/">Phuket hotels</a> system has found new information <a href="http://internetmarketing1.us">Internet Marketing</a> on the Semantic Web on affordable vacation homes with sea views in Spain. She briefly connects <a href="http://whichmerchantaccount.com/products/merchant-accounts/charge.com">charge.com</a> to the playroom to say hello to Charlotte, and video image automatically appears on the flat screen that is <a href="http://www.waverlyweightloss.com">Lose Weight</a> currently used by Charlotte. It then connects to Peter at the art fair in Paris.</p>
<p>He shows through his contact lens camera some of the sculptures that it intends <a href="http://www.fatlossdiet4idiots.net/">Fat loss for idiots</a> to purchase, and confirming your choice. By the time you select one of the menus that indicate what can be prepared with food that is available in the pantry and refrigerator. Then passed to <a href="http://www.chicagocondodirectory.com/">Chicago Condos</a> the demand for video on the channel to see the latest news program. Through which <a href="http://www.getyourexbackforever.com/">how to get your ex back</a> I still switch to flat screen in the bedroom where she will have her personal training session. Later that evening, after Peter has returned home, you are chatting with a friend <a href="http://www.visualsnap.co.uk/wedding-photographer-kent/4536840286">Wedding Photographer Kent</a> in the living room lit with custom <a href="http://backpackingthrougheurope.net/ten-of-the-best-places-to-visit-in-france/">places to visit in France</a> lighting. Watch the virtual presenter that informs them about the programs <a href="http://tread-mills.biz">Treadmill</a> and information that have been recorded by the storage server at home that day. The <a href="http://www.militaryvahomeloans.com/">va home loans</a> criticism of the vision of ambient intelligence is not without criticism [see, for example. David Wright, Serge <a href="http://paleodietlifestyle.com/">paleo diet</a> Gutwirth, Michael Friedewald et al, Safeguards <a href="http://www.bestchicagocondos.com/">Best Chicago Condos</a> in a world of Ambient Intelligence, Springer, Dordrecht, 2008]. Immersion, custom features, context-sensitive <a href="http://www.healthyhcg.com/hcg-drops.html">hcg</a> and anticipation raise social concerns, political and cultural rights by the loss of consumer <a href="http://www.pharmacytechnicianblog.com/">Pharmacy Technician</a> privacy, the concentration of power in large organizations, the fear of an increasingly <a href="http://www.ab-circle-pro.org">ab circle pro</a> individualized, fragmented society <a href="http://www.furniture-collection.co.uk/furniture/Oak-Furniture-Oak-Dining-Furniture/c24_46/index.html">dining table</a> and hyper-real environments, where virtual confused with the real (hyper). Several research groups and communities are investigating <a href="http://www.furniture-collection.co.uk/furniture/Oak-Furniture/c24/index.html">oak furniture</a> the social, economic, political and cultural aspects of ambient intelligence. New thinking <a href="http://www.learningtheblues.com/">Blues guitar lessons</a> on Ambient Intelligence therefore distances itself from some of the original features such as adaptive behavior and in advance and emphasizes empowerment and participation of placing control <a href="http://i-web-marketing.com/">web marketing</a> in the hands of the people rather than organizations. Social and political aspects of ambient intelligence ISTAG The advisory group suggested that the following features allow <a href="http://www.dealucks.com/modules/kohls">Kohls Coupons</a> the social acceptance of ambient intelligence: * AmI should facilitate human contact. * AmI should be orientated towards community and cultural strengthening. * Am I should help to increase <a href="http://adentalhygienist.com/">dental hygienist</a> knowledge and skills for work, better quality of work, citizenship and consumer choice. * AmI should inspire trust and confidence. * AmI should be consistent with long-term sustainability &#8211; personal, social <a href="http://www.dealucks.com/modules/boscovs">Boscovs Coupon Code</a> and environmental &#8211; and lifelong learning. * AmI should be easy to live with and <a href="http://bachelorettepartydepot.com">bachelorette party supplies</a> controllable by ordinary people. The business models of ambient intelligence ISTAG The <a href="http://freenintendo3ds.org/">free nintendo 3ds</a> group recognizes the following entry points AmI Business Outlook: * Initial value niche markets for premium industrial, commercial or public need for additional interfaces to support human performance moving fast or in difficult situations. * Start-up and spin-off opportunities from the identification of potential service requirements and make the services and to meet these new needs. * The high cost of low entry access based on a model of leadership of loss <a href="http://www.uncorkedventures.com/WineClubs">wine club</a> to create economies of scale (mass customization). * Hearing or customer care economy as a basis for &#8220;free&#8221; end-user services paid for by advertising or additional services or goods. * Self-provision &#8211; based on the network <a href="http://www.walkingshoesonline.com/mbt_shoes/">MBT Shoes</a> economies of large user communities providing information as a gift or near zero cost. Action research is a reflective process of <a href="http://www.a1credit.net/">free credit score</a> progressive problem solving led by individuals working with other teams or as part of a &#8220;community of practice&#8221; to improve the way to address issues and solve problems. Action research <a href="http://gadgetnovelty.com">top gadgets</a> can be done simply by the <a href="http://www.furniture-collection.co.uk/furniture/Oak-Furniture-Oak-Bedroom-Furniture/c24_323/index.html">bedroom furniture</a> action, hence the name. Action research can also be carried out by large organizations or institutions, assisted or guided by professional researchers, with <a href="http://www.howtogetbiggerbreastnaturally.com/">how to get bigger breast naturally</a> the aim of improving their strategies, practices and knowledge of the environments in which they practice. As designers and stakeholders, researchers working with others to propose a new course of action to help his community improve their working practices (Center for Cooperative Research Action). Kurt Lewin, then <a href="http://www.stunningdiamondearrings.com/">diamond stud earrings</a> a professor at MIT, first coined the term &#8220;action research&#8221; in about 1944. In 1946 his role as &#8220;action <a href="http://pianostreet.typepad.com/">classical piano music</a> research and minority problems&#8221;, described action research as &#8220;a comparative study on the <a href="http://www.smart-seoservices.co.uk">seo expert</a> conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action&#8221; that uses &#8220;a spiral of steps, each consisting of a circle of planning, action and determination of the facts on the outcome of the action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Action research <a href="http://www.debtsolutions4.me.uk/debt-help.aspx">debt help</a> is an interactive research process that balances problem solving actions undertaken in a collaborative partnership <a href="http://pianostreet.tumblr.com/">piano music</a> with the analysis based on data or research to understand underlying causes enabling future <a href="http://backlinks-hydra.com/">backlinks</a> predictions on personal change <a href="http://www.telusmobility.com/en/BC/htc_7_surround/index.shtml ">htc 7 surround</a> and organizational (Reason and Bradbury, 2002). After six decades of action research development, various methodologies have been developed to adjust the <a href="http://piano-street.blogspot.com/">piano video</a> balance to focus more on measures taken or more in research that is reflective understanding <a href="http://www.easydna.ie/">paternity test</a> of the actions. This tension between the 1. those who are more <a href="http://www.mycomfortersets.com/bed-in-a-bag-comforter-sets.html">bed in a bag</a> driven by the agenda of research and more driven by participants, 2. those who are motivated <a href="http://pianostreet.wordpress.com/">piano pieces</a> primarily by the pursuit of instrumental goals and primarily motivated by the aim of personal transformation, organizational, or social, and 3. First, second, the third person in the investigation, ie my research on my own action, aimed primarily at personal change, our research in our group (family / team), aimed primarily at improving the group, and &#8216;academic &#8216;research aimed primarily at theoretical generalization and / or large-scale change. Action research challenges traditional <a href="http://www.tuttle2000.com/">Wealthy Affiliate</a> social science, moving beyond the knowledge of experts created by external reflection of varying sampling to active theorizing moment to moment, gathering data and wondering what happens in the middle of the emerging structure. &#8220;Knowledge is always gained through action and for action. From this starting point, to question the validity of social knowledge is to question, not how to develop a reflective science about action, but how to develop a truly well-informed action &#8211; how to carry out a science of action &#8220;(Torbert 2002). In summary, action research is to perform as well as an experiment, so it is an empirical process. Chris Argyris <a href="http://www.fast-diet-plans.com/">diet plans</a> main theories &#8220;Action Science Main article: Action Science Chris Argyris&#8217; Action Science begins with the study of how humans design their actions in difficult situations. Human actions are designed to achieve <a href="http://www.mountainside.com/">drug rehab</a> intended consequences and governed by a set of environment variables. How the governing variables are treated in designing actions are the main differences between the unique learning loop and double loop learning. When actions are designed to achieve the desired outcomes and eliminate conflicts on the variables of government, a single-loop <a href="http://www.fastpaydayloans.mobi/faxless-payday-loans/">faxless payday loans</a> learning cycle usually ensues. On the other hand, when action is taken, not only to achieve the desired outcomes, but also to ask openly about the conflict and, possibly, to transform the governing variables, both in the cycles of single and double loop learning loop usually occur . (Argyris applies single <a href="http://www.fastpaydayloans.mobi/fast-cash-payday-loans/">fast cash payday loans</a> loop and double-circuit concepts not only to learning behaviors, but also organizational behavior in their models.) This is different from experimental research in which environmental variables are <a href="http://www.fast-diet-plans.com/diet-plan/a-successful-and-free-low-carb-diet-plan/">low carb diet</a> controlled and Researchers try to find out the cause and made in the isolated environment. John Heron and Peter Cooperative reason major research paper: Cooperative Research Cooperative Research, also known as collaborative research was first proposed by John Heron in 1971 and subsequently extended to Peter Reason. The <a href="http://www.liquidhcgdiet.com/">Liquid HCG Diet</a> main idea of collaborative research is&#8217; research &#8216;with&#8217; rather than &#8216;in&#8217; people. &#8221; It emphasizes that all active participants are fully involved in research decisions as co-researchers. cooperative <a href="http://www.quantumseolabs.com/blog">SEO blog</a> research creates a cycle of research among four types of knowledge: propositional knowledge (as in modern science), practical knowledge (knowledge that comes with actually doing what you propose), the experience to know (the comments we received on real time on our interaction with the rest of the world) and knowing presentation <a href="http://www.bulksupplementsdirect.co.uk/khxc/protein-blends.html">Protein Shakes</a> (the artistic process of trial through which ships new practices). The research process includes the following four stages in each cycle with the depth of experience and knowledge of the original proposal, or new proposals, in each cycle. Paulo Freire&#8217;s Participatory Action <a href="http://cnacertificationnews.com/">cna certification</a> Research (PAR)</p>
<p>Main article: participatory action research, participatory action research has emerged in recent years as an important method of intervention, development and change within communities and groups. It is <a href="http://www.taylormadeawning.com/">Retractable Awnings</a> now promoted and implemented by many international development agencies and university programs and a host of local community organizations around the world. PAR is based on critical pedagogy proposed by Paulo Freire as a response to traditional models of formal education, where the &#8220;master&#8221; is at the front and <a href="http://www.antiaging-health.com/">wrinkle cream</a> information &#8220;transmitted&#8221; to the &#8220;students&#8221; who are passive recipients. This was further developed in &#8220;Adult Education&#8221; model throughout Latin America. Orlando Fals-Borda (1925-2008) Colombian sociologist and political activist, was one of the leading advocates of &#8220;participatory action research (PAR in Spanish) in Latin <a href="http://www.weddingphotographersnorthumberland.com/wedding-photographer-newcastle">wedding photographer newcastle</a> America. Published&#8221; double history of the Coast &#8220;, a book that compares&#8221; history &#8220;official and unofficial&#8221; history &#8220;of the north coast of Colombia. William Torbert Development Action Research Action Research Development is a form of&#8221; simultaneously conducting action research and a disciplined leadership <a href="http://www.bulksupplementsdirect.co.uk/">Whey protein</a> practice increases the overall effectiveness of our actions. This action helps people, teams, organizations become more capable of self-transformation and therefore more creative, more aware, more just and sustainable &#8220;(Torbert, 2004). Action research challenges our attention to cover four different areas of experience (in the personal <a href="http://www.weddingphotographersnorthumberland.com/wedding-photography-north-east">wedding photography north east</a>, group, organization or scales) in the middle of the shares. This practice encourages punctuality &#8211; learning with intentional consciousness when the time &#8211; among individuals and in relation to the external world of nature and human institutions. We study the &#8220;pre-established universe internalized and externalized in the present, both in and out resonates with the past, and because it resonates with power and the future&#8221; (Torbert, 2001) &#8230; Jack Whitehead Life Theory and <a href="http://www.cumbrix.com.ar/">posicionamiento web</a> Research Jean McNiff action approaches in the generation of living educational theory http://www.actionresearch.net [Life theories; Whitehead, 1989), most recently explained in Whitehead and McNiff (2006), people generate explanations of educational influences in their own learning, learning from others and learning of social formations. Generating explanations to experience themselves as living contradictions in investigations of this kind, 'How I can improve on what I'm doing? "They <a href="http://www.customlanyardstogo.com/">lanyards</a> use cycles of reflection of the concerns expressed, (saying why you are concerned in relation to securities), to imagine possibilities for the development of action plans, performance and collecting data, assessing the influence of the action, modification of the concerns, ideas and action in light of the evaluations. The explanations include that affirms life, flowing energy values as explanatory principles. The action research in the development <a href="http://www.bestskylights.com/">skylights</a> organization Wendell L. French and Cecil Bell define organizational development (OD) at a time as improving the organization through action research. " If an idea <a href="http://www.wriwebsites.com/">Attorney Marketing</a> can be said to summarize the underlying philosophy of OD, it would be action research, as it was conceived by Kurt Lewin and later developed and extended by other behavioral scientists. Concerned about social change and, more <a href="http://www.canalip.com/aumentar-trafico/posicionamiento-web/posicionamiento-en-buscadores">posicionamiento en buscadores</a> particularly, to an effective change, social standing, Lewin believed that the motivation for change was <a href="http://www.business-supply.com/c-610-lateral-files.aspx">lateral file cabinets</a> strongly related to action: If people are active in decisions that affect them, they are more likely to new forms. "Rational social management," he said, "proceeds in a spiral of steps, each of which consists of a circle of planning, action and determination of the facts on the outcome of the action." Figure 1: System Model describes the process of action research of Lewin's change process involves three steps: Release: Faced with a dilemma or disconfirmation, the individual or group realizes the need to change.Changing: The situation is diagnosed and new models of behavior are <a href="http://www.canalip.com/es/blog/23-seo/332-como-hacer-linkbuilding-en-directorios">alta en buscadores</a> explored and tested.</p>
<p>Refreezing: Application of a new <a href="http://www.cystonovary.info/">cyst on ovary</a> behavior is evaluated, and if reinforcing, adopted.Figure 1 summarizes the steps and processes involved in planned change through action research. Action research is represented as a cyclical process of change. The cycle begins with planning a series of actions initiated by the customer and the agent of change working <a href="http://www.datanow.org/">cell phone lookup</a> together. The main elements of this stage include a preliminary diagnosis, data collection, feedback of results and planning of joint actions. In the language of <a href="http://lifecellcream.org/">Lifecell</a> systems theory, this is the input phase, in which the client is aware of the problems identified yet, you realize that you may need outside help to make changes, and shared with the consultant process of diagnosing the problem. The <a href="http://www.tarotprive.nl/">tarot</a> second stage of action research is action, or the phase transformation. This stage includes actions related to the learning process (perhaps in the form of role analysis) and the <a href="http://www.umcssa.org/Financial-assistance-for-single-mom.html">financial assistance</a> planning and execution of behavioral changes in the client's organization. As shown in Figure 1, the comments at this time would move by voting sensor A and have the effect of modifying the preliminary planning for learning activities the customer's system into better alignment with the objectives of change. Included in this stage is the planning activity of the action taken jointly by the consultant and members of the client <a href="http://www.lastminuteturkijespanje.nl/">last minute turkije</a> system. After the workshop sessions or learning disabilities, these action steps are carried out at work as part of the transformation stage. The <a href="http://www.gjshoes.com/">cheap jordans</a> third phase of action research is the output, or results, the phase. This stage includes the actual changes in behavior (if any) resulting from the corrective measures taken following the second stage. The data were collected again on the client system so that progress can be determined and the necessary adjustments <a href="http://www.freewindowsregistryrepair.net/">free registry repair</a> in learning activities can be made. small adjustments of this nature can do in learning activities by voting the sensor B (see Figure 1). major adjustments and reassessments DO return the draft to the first, or planning, the <a href="http://www.aboutwaterheaters.org/rinnai_tankless_water_heater.html">Rinnai Tankless Water Heater</a> stage of basic changes in the program. The action research model shown in Figure 1 follows closely <a href="http://www.woodlandforsale.org.uk/">woodland for sale</a> the Lewin repetitive cycle of planning, action and results measurement. It also shows other aspects of the general model of change Lewin. As indicated in the diagram, the planning stage is a period of thaw, or awareness of the problem. The action stage <a href="http://www.dogtrainingheaven.com/dog-eating-poop/dogs-eat-poop/">dogs eat poop</a> is a period of change, ie, try new ways of behaving in an effort to understand and cope with the problems of the system. (There is inevitable overlap between stages, as the boundaries are unclear and can not be in a continuous process). The output stage is a period of re-freezing, in which new behaviors are tested at work and, if successful and grow stronger, become a part of the repertoire of the research system behavior.Action resolution problem is a <a href="http://www.getautoloancredit.com/">auto credit</a> problem-centered, customer-focused and action oriented. It is the client system in a diagnosis of active learning, problem finding, and problem-solving process. The data are not simply returns in the form of a written report, but that <a href="http://www.myvipwebdesign.com/local-seo-services/professional-local-seo-services.html">Local SEO Services</a> feed in open joint sessions, and the client and change agent to assist in the identification and classification of specific problems <a href="http://www.fastfood.com/">fast food</a> in the development of methods to find their true causes, and developing plans to address them in a realistic and practical. The scientific method of data collection, hypothesis formation, hypothesis testing, and measure the results, although not <a href="http://www.towerofenglish.com/accent-reduction/">accent reduction</a> pursue the same rigor as in the laboratory, however, an integral part of the process. Action research also sets in motion a long-range, cyclical, self-correcting mechanism to maintain <a href="http://wifi-radio.net/">Wifi Radio</a> and improve the efficiency of the customer, leaving the system with useful and practical tools for self-analysis and self-renewal. Participatory video Participatory Video is a set of techniques that involve a group or community in shaping and creating his own film, to explore, solve and communicate their problems. Started in 1967 by Don Snowden Canadian defender, who changed the lives of Newfoundland Fogo Islanders. Then Director of the Extension Department at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Snowden <a href="http://hemorrhoidtreatmentfix.com/">hemorrhoid treatment</a> worked with filmmaker Colin Low, as part of the National Film Board of Canada Challenge for Change  program. To see the other films, different villagers <a href="http://www.myvipwebdesign.com/seo-agency/best-seo-agency-firm.html">SEO Agency</a> on the island realized they shared many of the same problems and that working together could solve some of them. The film also shows the politicians who lived far away and too busy to actually visit the island. As a result of this dialogue, government policies and actions have changed. The techniques <a href="http://www.aboutblinds.org/wooden_venetian_blinds.html">wooden venetian blinds</a> developed by Snowden is known as the Fogo process. His primary power is that the video is edited by the participants .. The <a href="http://www.umcssa.org/">Grants for single mothers</a> term "crowdsourcing" is an acronym for "multitude" and "outsourcing", coined by Jeff Howe in a June 2006 Wired magazine article "The Rise of Crowdsourcing." Howe explains that due to technological <a href="http://www.help-stockbrokers.com/">stock brokers</a> advances have allowed for cheap consumer electronics, the difference between professional and amateur has declined.</p>
<p>Companies are able to harness the talents of public and Howe states that "It is not outsourcing is" crowdsourcing. " Projects <a href="http://www.klemmer.com/">Leadership Development</a> that make use of intelligence of the group, such as gambling or LazyWeb Luis von <a href="http://www.hmiracle.info/">h miracle</a> Ahn's ESP, which predate word currency for several years. Recently, the Internet <a href="http://commercialmortgage-broker.com/">Commercial Mortgage Broker</a> has been used to publicize and manage projects of "crowdsourcing." A more detailed definition was introduced by Henk van Ess in September 2010 "Crowdsourcing is to channel the desire of practitioners to solve a problem and then freely share the answer <a href="http://www.childrensbedroomfurniturestore.co.uk">childrens bedroom furniture</a> with everyone" Overview Crowdsourcing is a problem in distributed production model y. problems In the classic use of the term, the problems are transferred to an unknown group to address in the form of an open call for solutions. User-also <a href="http://www.chikara-reiki-do.com">reiki</a> known as the crowd typically form in online communities, and people hold solutions. The public <a href="http://www.flagdiscounter.com">flags for sale</a> also directed through the solutions, the search for the best. These best solutions are then <a href="http://www.windowsinstallercleanuputility.net">Windows Installer cleanup utility</a> owned by the entity that transmitted the problem in the first place crowdsourced and the winners in the crowd sometimes rewarded. In some cases, this work is well <a href="http://www.babiespreferorganic.com/">Medifast Coupons</a> compensated either monetarily, with awards or recognition. In other cases, benefits may only prestige or intellectual satisfaction. Crowdsourcing may produce solutions <a href="http://www.diewahrheituberbauchmuskeln.de/">die wahrheit über bauchmuskeln</a> from amateurs or volunteers working in their spare time, or experts or <a href="http://www.golfcoursesguide.com">golf courses</a> small businesses that were unknown to the organization of initiation. Jeff Howe has differentiated <a href="http://marriageproblemshelp.org/">marriage problems</a> four types of strategies crowdsourcing: * * * * Crowdcreation Crowdfunding Crowdvoting crowd wisdom has extended the term to include <a href="http://naturalremediesbest.com">natural remedies</a> models in which discrete work is distributed to <a href="http://www.discountdiesel.co.uk">Fuel Cards</a> individuals in the crowd. Companies like CrowdFlower CloudCrowd and do not use "crowdsourcing" classic <a href="http://medicalcareerslist.org">medical careers</a> because people do not all participate together, or <a href="http://wordpresstutorials.tv">wordpress tutorials</a> collectively through such solutions. Perceived benefits of crowdsourcing include: * Problems can be explored at relatively little cost, often very quickly. * Payment is by results or even omitted (See this page in the German Wikipedia.) * The organization can tap a wide range of talent that could be present in your own <a href="http://haloxyl.net">hydrolyze</a> organization. * To hear the crowd, organizations get first hand information about the wishes of their clients. * The community can feel a brand-building affinity with the organization of "crowdsourcing," which is the result of a sense of ownership of cattle through the contribution and collaboration. In his article, "The Power of Crowdsourcing", Matt H. Evans argues that "crowdsourcing taps into the global world of ideas, help companies work through a design process quickly." This is usually available at relatively no cost, as people are always willing to share their ideas worldwide. The difference between crowdsourcing and ordinary outsourcing is a task or problem is outsourced to a defined, rather <a href="http://www.masternaut.co.uk">Vehicle Tracking</a> than a specific body. The difference between crowdsourcing and open source is that open source production is a cooperative activity initiated <a href="http://www.simplicityclaims.co.uk/">ppi</a> and voluntarily undertaken by members of the public. "Crowdsourcing" The activity begins with a client and the work can be done individually as well as a group, the base. Other differences between open source and crowdsourced production relate to the motivations of people to participate. Crowdsourcing also has the potential to be a problem solving mechanism for government use and non-profit. Urban planning and transit are the main areas of "crowdsourcing." One project to test crowdsourcing public <a href="http://www.themagicofmakingup.co.uk/">the magic of making up</a> participation process for planning transit in Salt Lake City has been running from 2008 to 2009, funded by a grant from U.S. Federal Transit Administration. Another <a href="http://www.ukppiclaims.org/">ppi claims</a> notable application of "crowdsourcing" to the problem of government is the solution to Exchange Patent Community Patent Review Project of the U.S. Patent Office and Trademark Office. Web-based "crowdsourcing" With the increased capabilities of web applications "in the last two decades [citation], the capabilities <a href="http://www.cellspying.net/">cell phone spy software</a> of the techniques of&#8221; crowdsourcing &#8220;has increased considerably, and now the term often refers only to web-based activities. Although the potential of Web-based &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; has existed for many years, has not been well implemented until recently.</p>
<p>Devun In an interview with Andrea Leah Grover, Grover <a href="http://www.insertt.com/dental-assistant/dental-assistant-salary.html">dental assistant salary</a> asked if Devun partnership projects on the Web tend to be different from face to face projects. Grover states that individuals tend to be more open, since they are not being judged or physically <a href="http://www.insertt.com/medical-transcriptionist/medical-transcriptionist-salary.html">medical transcriptionist salary</a> examined. Ultimately, it allows well-designed art projects, because people are less conscious or less conscious control to work. In an online environment there is more attention paid to the project instead of communicating with other people. An <a href="http://www.preis1.de/nikon-coolpix-p100-digitalkamera-kompaktkamera.html">nikon coolpix p100</a> important example of Web based &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221;, also mentioned in the original book by Howe, are social bookmarks (also known as collaborative tagging). In social systems bookmarks, users assign tags to resources shared with other <a href="http://www.hyperstreet.com">Build a website</a> users, which has led to a type of organization of information that emerges from this process of &#8220;crowdsourcing.&#8221; Other important examples are the competitions web-based idea. Recent research has shown that consensus on the stable distribution and a simple shared vocabularies in fact arise in such systems, even in the absence of a central <a href="http://www.promedicalsupplies.com/">medical supplies</a> controlled vocabulary. Collaboratition &#8220;Collaboratition&#8221; is a neologism to describe a type of &#8220;crowdsourcing used for problems requiring a collaborative effort or cooperation to succeed, but the competition used as a motivator for participation or performance. A good example is the experiment collaboratition in 2009 DARPA &#8220;crowdsourcing.&#8221; DARPA balloon placed 10 markers across the United States and the teams <a href="http://www.insertt.com/x-ray-technician/ultrasound-technician-salary.html">ultrasound technician salary</a> face the challenge of competing to be the first to report the location of all balloons. The collaboration of efforts are required to complete the challenge quickly and, in addition to the competitive motivation of the competition as a whole, the winning team (MIT, in less than seven hours) established its own &#8220;collaborapetitive&#8221; <a href="http://www.cedarwooddoghouses.com/">dog houses</a> environment to generate participation on your computer. Another form of collaboration can be found within crowdfunding, inspired by &#8220;crowdsourcing.&#8221; Crowdfunding collaboration assumes a different role, describes the collective cooperation care, and trust that the network people sharing their money together, usually via the Internet, to <a href="http://www.absolutehometextiles.co.uk/products/Luxury-Towels-500-gsm.html">luxury towels</a> support the efforts undertaken by other persons or organizations . Crowdfunding happens for a variety of purposes, from disaster relief to citizen journalism to artists seeking support from the fans, to political campaigns. The Age of Stupid <a href="http://www.electroniccigarettereviews.org/">electronic cigarette reviews</a> is perhaps the most publicized and successful to date, this film raises 1.2 million U.S. dollars through public funding, and are also used crowd sourcing for distribution and exhibition worldwide. The first example The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) can provide an early example of crowdsourcing. An open call was made to the community for the contributions <a href="http://www.mycarinsurancecomparison.com/">car insurance comparison</a> of volunteers to index all the words in the English language and such contributions for each and every one of its uses. In the 70-year project, which received more than 6,000,000 items. DEO Making detailed in the surgeon of Crowthorne by Simon Winchester. Augusto Boal Theatre of the Oppressed provides the first examples of &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; in the theater. Boal models emphasize the <a href="http://www.adviceconsolidationdebt.com/debt-consolidation">debt consolidation</a> participants and the influence of their collaboration is in their actions. In 1994, Northeast Consulting compiled a database of trends in the market. This database was collected from numerous sources, providing an early example of &#8220;crowdsourcing.&#8221; Recent examples Main article: List of projects of &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; Resource <a href="http://www.containapet.com/DogFence.html">dog fence</a> Andrea Grover, curator of art 2006 &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; Phantom Captain: Art and Crowdsourcing, said in an interview that &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; removes a financial barrier that prohibits <a href="http://medigap-insurance.org/">Medigap Insurance</a> Most people participate in the art as &#8220;Internet real estate is essentially free.&#8221; Grover believes that the main appeal of &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; is the <a href="http://www.cheap-car-insurance-britain.co.uk/">online car insurance</a> satisfaction you get by working with a community. People involved in projects of &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; are often anonymous, and Grover states that &#8220;people reveal more when they are face to face&#8221;, because &#8220;there is some <a href="http://www.absolutehometextiles.co.uk/products/Mattress-Protector-Waterproof-Terry-Towelling.html">mattress protector</a> assurance of not being physically present, in addition to the appeal of &#8221;crowdsourcing.&#8221; Dion Hinchcliffe explains in his article Crowdsourcing: 5 <a href="http://www.van-insurance-britain.co.uk/">cheap van insurance</a> reasons to not just for Start Ups Anymore several reasons why crowdsourcing companies find attractive. These include, but are not limited to, the discharge capacity of peak demand, access to cheaper production factors, which leads to better <a href="http://www.domainnamestraffic.com/">Domain Names</a> results, and conduct problems that would have been too difficult to resolve internally. &#8220;Crowdsourcing&#8221; allows companies to present problems in which employees can work on problems of science, manufacturing, medicine, biotechnology, etc, with monetary rewards for successful <a href="http://articlepackages.com/">PLR articles</a> solutions. Companies can design crowdsource issues, ranging from simple web design (crowdSPRING) or more complicated <a href="http://getpaydayloan.us/cash-advance/">cash advance</a> design problems.</p>
<p>Although difficult to <a href="http://www.shedsforsale.net/">storage shed</a> crowdsourcing complex tasks, simple tasks can be crowdsourced work cheap and effective. Software testing and other services can be crowdsourced. Crowdsourced customer support enables enterprises to rely on clients to resolve problems and questions from other customers. Conflict of the ethical, social <a href="http://www.car-buying-strategies.com/car-buying.html">invoice prices</a> and economic crowdsourcing are subject to much debate. For example, author and media critic Douglas Rushkoff in an interview published in Wired News, expressed ambivalence about the term and its implications. Co-founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales is also an outspoken critic of the term. Some reports have focused on the negative effects of &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; to <a href="http://www.oexstreet.com/">options trading system</a> business owners, particularly in regard to how a crowdsourced project can sometimes end up costing a business more than a traditionally outsourced project. Some potential hazards of crowdsourcing include: * Added the costs <a href="http://www.van-insurance-britain.co.uk/">van insurance</a> of bringing a project to an acceptable conclusion. * Increasing the likelihood that a crowdsourced project fail due to lack of monetary motivation, too few participants, the lower quality of work, lack of interest in the project, global language barriers, or difficulty managing a large scale, the crowdsourced project. * Market under the salary or without salary. barter <a href="http://hairtransplantuk.org/hair-transplant-cost/">hair transplant cost</a> agreements are often associated <a href="http://www.premierclaimsplus.co.uk/ppi_claims.asp">ppi claim</a> with &#8220;crowdsourcing.&#8221; * There are no written contracts, nondisclosure agreements, or agreements with employees or friendly terms with employees crowdsourced. * Difficulties in maintaining a working relationship with crowdsourced workers for the duration of a project. * Susceptibility results faulty equipment caused by efforts, malicious work. Although some critics believe that &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; <a href="http://www.hishairclinic.com/">hair loss</a> exploits or abuses of individuals for their work, studies on the motivations of the masses still have not shown that the crowds feel exploited. Conversely, many individuals experience a multitude significant benefits from their participation <a href="http://www.cheap-car-insurance-britain.co.uk/">car insurance quotes</a> in the application of &#8220;crowdsourcing.&#8221; Other authors discuss both the risks and benefits of using crowdsourcing as a way of balancing global inequalities. Project as Amazon.com &#8216;s &#8220;The Turk&#8221;, however, did a significant advance in the treatment of these issues in recent years. &#8220;The Turk&#8221; seeks to <a href="http://www.absolutedaytrader.com/">emini trading</a> empower companies, developers and creators of any type of lubricant on the relationship between them and the crowds. This is <a href="http://mexico.independent-reviews.net/">hemorroides</a> accomplished by creating a platform through which the crowds and employers to communicate and conduct transactions in a manner that is safe for both parties. In an interview with Andrea Grover Leah Devun the question: &#8220;Do you think that&#8221; crowdsourcing &#8220;removes <a href="http://www.shedsforsale.net/">storage sheds</a> an economic barrier that could prevent people from participating in art?&#8221; Grover answer <a href="http://www.cheap-car-insurance-britain.co.uk/">car insurance uk</a> was yes. Grover went on to explain that &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; was originally based on the economy. It was designed for companies to be cost-efficient and reduce costs. Grover also provides an example of a project of &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; that was lost. Justcurio. us was a website where <a href="http://www.liznicolejewelry.com/">personalized jewelry</a> users ask questions and receive answers from other users who visit the site. Over time, degraded people to ask questions for pornography. Grover reports that &#8220;maybe <a href="http://www.cheap-car-insurance-britain.co.uk/">compare car insurance</a> just a question is too simple. Perhaps there should be more complex.&#8221; Crowdsourcing Brand marketing has attracted the attention of brand marketers as a way to engage customers using social media. Doritos &#8220;Crash <a href="http://www.cheap-car-insurance-britain.co.uk/">car insurance quote</a> the Super Bowl&#8221; campaign is a prominent example of a fully integrated and successful. Doritos fans create their own ads for a chance <a href="http://www.premierclaimsplus.co.uk/">mis sold ppi</a> to win a trip for the game, cash of $ 25,000, and the fame of the establishment of a Super Bowl ad. &#8220;Crowdsourcing&#8221; for <a href="http://www.cheap-car-insurance-britain.co.uk/">cheap car insurance</a> brands not always work. Levia, a marketer of medical devices, not to generate crowdsourcing activity with a similar promotion. Lacked the prerequisites for a crowd sufficient motivation and a reasonable expectation <a href="http://www.premierclaimsplus.co.uk/ppi_reclaim.asp">ppi reclaim</a> of hard work.</p>
