<h2>So what is Article AutoTasker?</h2>
<p>Article AutoTasker is a revolutionary new Windows&reg; application which allows you to create and manage tasks (HITs) you submit to Amazon's Mechanical Turk online service (mturk) for the sole purpose of having articles written from scratch of having an existing article rewritten.</p>
<h2>So what is Amazon&reg; Mechanical Turk?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mturk.com">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. The Mechanical Turk service gives people access to a diverse, on-demand, scalable workforce and gives workers a selection of thousands of tasks to complete whenever it's convenient.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mturk.com">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> is based on the idea that there are still many things that human beings can do much more effectively than computers, such as identifying objects in a photo or video, performing data de-duplication, transcribing audio recordings, or researching data details. Traditionally, tasks like this have been accomplished by hiring a large temporary workforce (which is time consuming, expensive, and difficult to scale) or have gone undone.</p>
<h2>How does Article AutoTasker use Amazon&reg; Mechanical Turk?</h2>
<p>Article AutoTasker allows you to submit HITs to the Amazon&reg; Mechanical Turk marketplace requesting new articles to be created based on specific keywords/topics or to have an existng article rewritten.</p>
<h2>What is a HIT?</h2>
<p>HIT = <strong>Human Intelligence Task</strong>. A HIT is a task which requires a human to answer. In this instance, we require a human (not a computer or spinner) to create a unquie new or rewritten <strong>readable</strong> article for us.</p>
<h2>What are some of the features of Article AutoTasker?</h2>

<li>Plus lots more...</li>
</ul>
