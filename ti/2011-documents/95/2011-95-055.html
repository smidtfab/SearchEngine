		<p>As one of the founders of the original Napster and CloudMark (an anti-spam service), Jordan Ritter, has always been fascinated by the idea of combining the power of the cloud and the potential of human capital. Last April, he met up with Alex Edelstein, a former CloudMark executive, to hammer out their next business plan.</p>
<p>Over a round of beers, the idea for CloudCrowd was born.</p>
<p>Like CrowdFlower and Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk, CloudCrowd is trying to bring labor into the cloud, by creating a vast network of workers around the globe. Today, there are roughly 25,000 workers, who have completed more than a million tasks since the site&#8217;s launch in October 2009. That represents a small fraction of CrowdFlower&#8217;s claim to 500,000 workers, but CEO Edelstein says their force is quickly expanding, with some 2,000 additions each week. Although it took 7 months to reach the one million task mark, Edelstein predicts they&#8217;ll reach 2 million jobs in 8 weeks. See video above.</p>
<p>CloudCrowd has two main segments. The bulk of its business is client-driven work: a company submits tasks to CloudCrowd and the service will farm that out to eligible workers. Workers access CloudCrowd through a Facebook app, where they can pick available tasks and arrange payment.The tasks can be as simple as checking the quality of an image or involve the translation of entire web pages. Because pricing is determined by the level of difficulty, the payouts range from one penny to several dollars. Once a task is completed, a different user will check the finished product for an additional fee, creating a level of quality control.</p>
<p>The second part of their business is a new layer of consumer-facing services.</p>
<p>CloudCrowd recently launched EditZen, a simple web site, where consumers can submit pages for editing at $4 a page. The company will soon launch TranslationZen, which will offer translation services at $19.95 a page (far cheaper than some alternatives which are priced at $60 a page).</p>
<p>Aside from their consumer services, CloudCrowd&#8217;s cut varies widely depending on the job&#8212; ranging from a 20% cut to as high as 80%. The average worker doesn&#8217;t get paid handsomely for their task, but it can be a nice source for supplemental income&#8212; especially for workers in developing countries where salaries are generally well below America&#8217;s mean. In fact, the company now attracts more workers outside of the US, with a heavy concentration in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (many from Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore).</p>
<p>The startup, which has yet to reach profitability, is a 15 person operation in San Francisco with modest funding. So far Edelstein is their sole investor, with $1.5 million in the project, but they are talking to major VC firms about a Series A round.</p>
<p>The main challenge for a company like CloudCrowd is keeping pace with its ever-growing workforce. Edelstein admits that feeding the machine with sufficient volume and variety is a difficult endeavor in this early stage. The company has not spent a significant amount of capital on marketing and courting clients, instead, CloudCrowd still relies on word of mouth to attract new business.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well it&#8217;s true that the number one complaint of our workers is give me more work, I want more availability of jobs. In both of the previous outsourcing, disruptive eras, the era of manufacturing moving to China and developing nations and the era of white collar work moving to India it took years of explaining, educating and showing corporations and all sorts of people who had work how much they could benefit&#8230;how consistent the work quality could be,&#8221; Edelstein says. &#8220;We don&#8217;t expect that overnight every single company in the Fortune 500 is going to outsource significant amounts of their work to the internet cloud but we&#8217;re sure that it&#8217;s going to happen over time.&#8221;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key to their success (and beating rivals like CrowdFlower) lies in the credibility of their workforce and amassing as much information as possible on the skills of their workers. According to Ritter, the system&nbsp; is structured to create dynamic profiles on each user. Every time a user completes a task and that task is reviewed, CloudCrowd will learn how reliable that user is and which skills they excel at. If all that information is organized properly, that could be highly valuable for a client who needs to finish a targeted task in a short time frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building sort of what we call the credibility graph of known reliable people on the internet,&#8221; Ritter says. &#8220;If there are particular customers who&#8230; say, &#8216;I want a thousand reliable people on the internet to do a particular job for me.&#8217; Well today you really can&#8217;t find that. Where would you find 1,000 reliable people on the internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cond&eacute; promoted Bob Sauerberg, former head of consumer marketing  (read: circulation) to its presidency. Bob is one of the good guys of  Cond&eacute; Nast (I don&rsquo;t mean to damn him with faint praise there &hellip; sorry,  couldn&rsquo;t resist); he&rsquo;s smart, mature, experienced. (I worked with him a  good deal when I was at Advance&rsquo;s parent company and he was at  Fairchild; I should add that none of what I&rsquo;m saying here comes from the  slightest contemporary knowledge of the company; haven&rsquo;t been in the  cafeteria for many months.) Bob knows management and consumer marketing.  The age of the ad sales guy is over because the age of the ad is over.</p>
<p>The problem is going to be that there is only <em>more</em> competition in content and so trying to suddenly charge <em>more</em> flies in the face of basic economics. The absurdity of the strategy  struck me yesterday as Amazon tried to sell me a subscription to Time  for 28.8 cents an issue while Time is trying to sell its iPad issues for  $4.99 and I see no reason to buy either. In what world do these  economics make sense? In their dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to collect income from the consumer,&rdquo; Townsend told The Times earlier.  &ldquo;An annual magazine subscription may be something like anywhere  bet $12 and $24. So I&rsquo;m currently locked into a model that says I  get a buck or two a month. How about I get a buck for a click?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dream on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not wrong that they need to get money from consumers but  they&rsquo;re not going to get it for content. Sorry guys. But as Google schooled the newspaper industry (I&rsquo;ll substitute appropriate words):</p>
<blockquote><p>The large profit margins  enjoyed in the past  were built on an artificial scarcity: Limited choice for advertisers as  well as readers. With the Internet, that scarcity has been taken away  and replaced by abundance. No  will be able to restore   revenues to what they were before the emergence of online  . It is not a question of analog dollars versus digital dimes,  but rather a realistic assessment of how to make money in a world of  abundant competitors and consumer choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, I suggest they have to get new revenue through commerce &mdash;  through selling the things they once advertised now that advertisers are  deserting them to sell direct. Problem is, that&rsquo;s hard, as Cond&eacute; knows  best from its experience with Style.com, which started as an attempt to  create a high-end store (I worked there then). They created it in  partnership with a retailer and the retailer bagged the effort when  times got tough in the first bubble; it then became another ad-supported  site. But the strategy wasn&rsquo;t wrong. Problem is, there is no retail  expertise in the company.</p>
<p>More recently, Cond&eacute; should have bought Net-a-Porter but instead luxury conglomerate Richemont snarfed it up. (Disclosure: I  spoke at Richemont&rsquo;s corporate retreat recently.) Cond&eacute; should buy Gilt  to establish new skills, a new relationship with customers, and new  revenue. Its content then becomes just added value: the Cinnabon&rsquo;s in  the mall.</p>
<p>A media company going into retail and selling in areas held by former  advertisers has precedent: Media News&rsquo; Salt Lake City paper became a real estate broker and undersold the entire business in town. The  Telegraph, as I like to point out, sells everything from hangers to wine  to betting to its readers.</p>
<p>But if Cond&eacute; and other media companies are going into retail, they  need entirely new skills of merchandising and sales, an entirely new  financial structure to cope with inventory costs and tight margins, the  ability to cope with entirely new competitors and suppliers (that is,  former advertisers &mdash; but, worse, Amazon), and an entirely new efficiency  (forget the cafeteria; they&rsquo;d be lucky to have a Wal-Mart lunch room  with vending machines as a profit center).</p>
<p>They also have to defeat a calcified, entitled culture. For that, I&rsquo;d  suggest they buy Gawker Media to get the incredibly popular competitor  Jezebel and to infuse the company with a new culture. Make Nick Denton  editorial director and COO and then watch the fun.</p>
<p>I doubt they heard any of this from KcKinsey because in the few  encounters I&rsquo;ve had with them they remix known models rather than invent  new ones, which is what is called for here. I&rsquo;ll bet they proposed  cutting some costs (done) and remixing revenue (started) when what&rsquo;s  really needed is a complete restrategizing.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&rdquo;m wrong. Maybe 4 Times Square will become the world&rsquo;s lushest mall, with one helluva food court.</p>
<p>Nevermind my advice. The moral of this story remains that advertising  is next to fall into the black hole (as a Time Inc. president once dubbed this damned internet thing). Welcome to Bob Garfield&rsquo;s Chaos Scenario.</p>
