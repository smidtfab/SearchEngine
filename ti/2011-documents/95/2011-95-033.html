      In 1769, Hungarian nobleman Wolfgang von Kempelen astonished
      Europe by building a mechanical chess-playing automaton that
      defeated nearly every opponent it faced. A life-sized wooden
      mannequin, adorned with a fur-trimmed robe and a turban,
      Kempelen's "Turk" was seated behind a cabinet and toured
      Europe confounding such brilliant challengers as Benjamin
      Franklin and Napoleon Bonaparte. To persuade skeptical
      audiences, Kempelen would slide open the cabinet's doors to
      reveal the intricate set of gears, cogs and springs that powered
      his invention. He convinced them that he had built a machine
      that made decisions using artificial intelligence. What they did
      not know was the secret behind the Mechanical Turk: a human chess
      master cleverly concealed inside.
    </p><p>
      Today, we build complex software applications based on the
      things computers do well, such as storing and retrieving large
      amounts of information or rapidly performing
      calculations. However, humans still significantly outperform the
      most powerful computers at completing such simple tasks as
      identifying objects in photographs - something children can do
      even before they learn to speak.
    </p><p>
      When we think of interfaces between human beings and computers,
      we usually assume that the human being is the one requesting
      that a task be completed, and the computer is completing the
      task and providing the results. What if this process were
      reversed and a computer program could ask a human being to
      perform a task and return the results? What if it could
      coordinate many human beings to perform a task?
    </p><p>
      Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a web services API for computers
      to integrate "artificial, artificial intelligence" directly into
      their processing by making requests of humans. Developers use
      the Amazon Mechanical Turk web services API to submit tasks to
      the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, approve completed tasks,
      and incorporate the answers into their software applications. To
      the application, the transaction looks very much like any remote
      procedure call: The application sends the request, and the
      service returns the results. Behind the scenes, a network of
      humans fuels this artificial, artificial intelligence by coming
      to the web site, searching for and completing tasks, and
      receiving payment for their work.

      Your application interacts with the Amazon Mechanical Turk web
      service to ask questions to be answered by human beings.  In
      Mechanical Turk terms, you are the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Requester</em></span> of information, and your
      application is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Requester application</em></span>.
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>Workers</em></span>, the human beings providing the
      answers, find and answer your questions using the Mechanical
      Turk web site (<a href="http://mturk.amazon.com/" target="_top">http://mturk.amazon.com/</a>).
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="d0e254"/>Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs)</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Each question your application asks is a <span class="emphasis"><em>Human Intelligence Task</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>HIT</em></span>.  A
      HIT contains all of the information a Worker needs to answer the
      question, including information about how the question is shown
      to the Worker and what kinds of answers would be considered
      valid.
    </p><p>
      Each HIT has a <span class="emphasis"><em>reward</em></span>, an amount of money
      you pay to the Worker that successfully completes
      the HIT.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="d0e270"/>Assignments</h2></div></div></div><p>
      When a Worker finds a HIT to complete, the Worker
      <span class="emphasis"><em>accepts</em></span> the HIT.  Mechanical Turk creates
      an <span class="emphasis"><em>assignment</em></span> to track the completion of
      the task and store the answer the Worker submits.
    </p><p>
      Mechanical Turk reserves the assignment while the Worker is
      actively working on it, so no other Worker can accept it or
      submit results.  If the Worker fails to complete the assignment
      before the deadline you specified (the Worker
      <span class="emphasis"><em>abandons</em></span> the HIT), or if the Worker chooses
      not to complete it after accepting it (the Worker
      <span class="emphasis"><em>returns</em></span> the HIT), the assignment is once
      again made available for other Workers to accept.
    </p><p>
      A HIT can have multiple assignments.  This is useful for
      gathering multiple answers to a single question for comparison,
      or for collecting multiple opinions.  A Worker can only accept a
      HIT once, so a HIT with multiple assignments is guaranteed to be
      performed by multiple Workers.
    </p><p>You can specify the maximum number of assignments that any Worker
    can accept for your HITs. You can set two types of limits: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The maximum number of assignments any Worker can accept for a specific HIT type you've created.</p></li><li><p>The maximum number of assignments any Worker can accept for all your HITs that don't otherwise have a HIT-type-specific limit already assigned.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="d0e300"/>Approval and Payment</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Once a HIT has all of the answers that were requested, or an
      expiration date you specified has passed, your application
      retrieves the assignments with the answer data.  If an
      assignment's answer satisfies the question, you
      <span class="emphasis"><em>approve</em></span> the assignment.  You may
      <span class="emphasis"><em>reject</em></span> the assignment if the HIT was not
      completed successfully.
    </p><p>
      Mechanical Turk automatically processes payment of the reward
      to the Worker once the assignment is
      approved.  The reward is transferred from your
      Amazon.com account to the Worker's Amazon.com account.
      You can deposit or withdraw funds from your Mechanical Turk
      account at any time using the Requester web site (<a href="http://requester.mturk.amazon.com/" target="_top">http://requester.mturk.amazon.com/</a>).
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="d0e316"/>Qualifications and Quality Control</h2></div></div></div><p>
      You can manage which Workers can accept a particular HIT
      using <span class="emphasis"><em>Qualifications</em></span>.  A Qualification is
      an attribute assigned by you to a Worker.  It includes a name
      and a number value.  A HIT can include <span class="emphasis"><em>Qualification requirements</em></span> that a Worker must meet before they are
      allowed to accept the HIT.
    </p><p>
      You create a <span class="emphasis"><em>Qualifiation type</em></span> to
      represent a Worker's skill or ability.  A Worker discovers your
      Qualification type either by browsing HITs that require it, or
      by browsing Qualification types directly.  The Worker requests a
      Qualification of the type, and you grant the request with a value.
    </p><p>
      A Qualification type may include a <span class="emphasis"><em>Qualification test</em></span>.  A Qualification test is a set of questions,
      similar to a HIT, that the Worker must answer to request the
      Qualification.  You can grant the request manually by
      evaluating the Worker's test answers, or you can
      include an <span class="emphasis"><em>answer key</em></span> for the test when
      they create the Qualification type.  For Qualification types
      with a test and an answer key, Mechanical Turk processes
      Qualification requests automatically, and sets Qualification
      values as specified by the answer key.
    </p><p>
      Mechanical Turk provides several <span class="emphasis"><em>system Qualifications</em></span> that represent a Worker's account
      history.  The values are updated continuously as the Worker uses
      the system.  A HIT may include Qualification requirements based
      on these system Qualifications.
