		    <p>I worked at a company that was attempting to&nbsp;corner the market on topic-based sentiment classification of forum and blog content.&nbsp; While I was there I had the opportunity to work with some of the most intelligent and inspirational code, tools and software for probalistic and NLP sentiment analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://autonomy.com"><strong>Autonomy</strong></a><strong> - </strong>A massive, sprawling multi-tiered system used for comprehension and storage of unstructed data.&nbsp; Autonomy can crawl, index, federate, partition, etc. and does so while requiring a ton of horsepower, a ton of money and a pile of scientists to use.&nbsp; Well, at least that&#39;s how it was implmented when I joined.&nbsp; One one mind I got the impression that it was implemented improperly yet on another I observed that the system was a clever accumulation of WordNet, the GeneralInquirer and OpenNLP.</li>
<li><a href="http://lexalytics.com"><strong>Lexalytics</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>- </strong>A scarily accurate topic-based sentiment parsing engine, with confidences.&nbsp; And, it&#39;s trainable,&nbsp;just like adding Frames to WordNet.&nbsp; Peeking under the covers reveals WordNet and OpenNLP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OpenSource:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rapid-miner.com"><strong>RapidMiner</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;- </strong>Where to begin, where to begin?&nbsp; My favorite application next to SQL Server, ever.&nbsp; This little ball of wax has enough features, twists and turns to place it along a Final Fantasy game at your local GameStop.&nbsp; Examples are provided for Text Mining and the CrossValidation and K-Folds evaluators are top notch for displaying class recall and precision.&nbsp; Through and through, Rapid Miner makes SSAS seem like a toy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://nclassifier.sourceforge.net/">NClassifier</a></strong> - The best damn little Bayesian classifier out there, for .NET.&nbsp; Well, actually, it&#39;s the only Bayesian classifier I would use.&nbsp; It&#39;s fast, easy to use and you can supply your own word weights, or have the classifer calculate them for you.&nbsp; Combining NClassifier with the weighted word lists installed by Lexalytics yields surprisingly accurate results.&nbsp; A basic tokenizer is provided, and it works well.&nbsp; Look to the SNOWBALL tokenizer package from lucene.net for an upgrade.&nbsp; Also, a basic summarizer is provided, but isn&#39;t as complete or thorough as the OpenTextSummarizer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/OTS"><strong>OpenTextSumarizer</strong></a>&nbsp;- Yet another great find.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent text summarization includes templates for multiple languages, which could probably be extended to detect language.&nbsp; The synonym rollup is easily extended and overall, works really, really well when provided with clean, tokenized text.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ebswift.com/OpenSource/WordNetSQLServer/"><strong>WordNetSQLServer</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;- </strong>WordNet for SQL Server.&nbsp; What more is there to say?&nbsp; :)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sharpnlp"><strong>SharpNLP</strong></a><strong> - </strong>As probabilistic approaches will only take you so far, you&#39;re going to need a parser.&nbsp; Included a WordNet interface.</li>
<li><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/"><strong>Lucene.NET</strong></a>&nbsp;- The SNOWBALL stemmer is the evolution of the Porter Stemmer, as written by Martin Porter.</li>
<li><a href="http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/"><strong>LingPipe</strong></a> - Not .NET but close enough.&nbsp; (Java)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training Sets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data/">Movie Review Training Data</a> / <a href="http://kmandcomputing.blogspot.com/2008/06/opinion-mining-with-rapidminer-quick.html">Tutorial</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">General Inquirer Categories</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, if you aim to solve the problem of topic based sentiment, and have money to spend, purchase Lexalytics and extend it&#39;s already broad understanding by teaching it new grammer.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re into a challenge, the OpenSource tools and the training sets listed above are all you need to use to solve the problem.</p>
