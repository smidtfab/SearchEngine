Abstract: 
<br></br>
Service Orientation has become popular due to dynamic market conditions and changing customer needs. A successful service oriented architecture implementation requires the need for right identification of services from business process models. Service identification is considered to be the main activity in the modeling of service oriented solution, as errors made during service identification flows down through detailed design and implementation of activities. 
<br></br>
Though service orientation has been an important milestone in many enterprise transformation initiatives, there hasn't been much work on identification of services. Services have been identified and are used in day to day transactions, but they are limited to exchange of information between partners (two different organizations) or infrastructure related. Functionalities that are widely used across all applications such as security, auditing has been considered for servicification. In some other cases, business processes have been considered as simple orchestrated set of web services with each activity mapping to a single web service. 
<br></br>
Adopting any service identification approach for Service Orientation without verification would rather be impractical for the simple reason being that no common notion of service can be established among stakeholders. It is essential to assert if all services identified provide necessary value and exhibit acceptable technical health (flexibility, reuse etc). To be more effective, there is a need for a methodology that can quantitatively measure the candidature of services with respect to business process models. With such automation, a platform can be provided to bootstrap service analysis where stakeholders can continually model and refine services based on predefined criteria. 
<br></br>
This tutorial is intended for researchers and industry practitioners who are interested in Service Oriented Architecture and Service Analysis. The tutorial gives a deeper insight on service analysis and service identification methodologies. Though our methodology follows the prescribed top down approach while recognizing the importance of starting with business models for service identification, it stands different as it is based on mathematical model rather than heuristics or questionnaire based. Our method adopts quantitative way of groping set of business activities and measuring the service candidacy of those groups based on well defined principles. It also demonstrates an automated tool for service analysis.

Abstract: 
<br></br>
Data storage is a particularly challenging obstacle to creating Internet-scale applications and services. Data partitioning and replication along with loose coupling and simple service interfaces have become successful architecture guidelines to preventing scalability issues. Distribution of storage infrastructure, however, provokes a fundamental trade-off challenge known as the CAP principle. In this context, relaxing consistency requirements and trading consistency for higher availability has become a successful modus operandi for Internet-scale systems.
Key-value data stores provide storage capabilities for a wide range of applications and services, from Amazon's shopping carts to Zynga's social gaming engine. We will explore common mechanisms employed by Internet-scale key-value data stores, such as Dynamo, Cassandra, Sherpa and Membase, and discuss how key-value data stores are used in support of representative Internet applications and services.
To evaluate and compare eventually consistent data stores, metrics and benchmarking tools are
needed. We review metrics proposed by the distributed systems and service computing communities and argue for a novel ''consistency benchmarking'' model as a systematic approach to measure relaxed consistency.

Abstract: 

Over the past few years the crowdsourcing paradigm has evolved from its humble beginnings as isolated purpose-built initiatives, such as Wikipedia and Elance and Mechanical Turk to a growth industry employing over 2 million knowledge workers, contributing over half a billion dollars to the digital economy. Web 2.0 provides the technological foundations upon which the crowdsourcing paradigm evolves and operates, enabling networked experts to work collaboratively to complete a specific task. 
<br></br>
Crowdsourcing has a potential to significantly transform the business processes, by incorporating the knowledge and skills of globally distributed experts to drive business objectives, at shorter cycles and lower cost.  Many interesting and successful examples exist, such as GoldCorp, TopCoder, Threadless, etc. However, to fully adopt this mechanism enterprises, and benefit from appealing value propositions, in terms of reducing the time-to-value, a set of challenges remain, in order for enterprises to retain the brand, achieve high quality contributions, and deploy crowdsourcing at the minimum cost.
<br></br>
Enterprise crowdsourcing poses interesting challenges for both academic and industrial research along the social, legal, and technological dimensions.
In this tutorial we present a landscape of existing crowdsourcing applications, targeted to the enterprise domain. We describe the challenges that researchers and practitioners face when thinking about various aspects of enterprise crowdsourcing. First, to establish technological foundations, what are the interaction models and protocols between the Enterprise and the crowd (including different types of crowd, such as internal, external and hybrid models). Secondly, how is crowdsourcing going to face the challenges in quality assurance, enabling Enterprises to optimally leverage the scalable workforce. Thirdly, what are the novel (Web) applications enabled by Enterprise crowdsourcing, and how can existing business processes be transformed for crowd consumption.
