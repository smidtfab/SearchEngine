				<p>The <b>acceptable quality limit (AQL)</b> is the worst tolerable process <b>average</b> in percentage or ratio, that is still considered acceptable: that is, it is at an <b>acceptable quality level</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-Dodge_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dodge-0"><span></span>1<span></span></a></sup> Closely related terms are the rejectable quality limit and level (RQL).<sup id="cite_ref-Dodge_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dodge-0"><span></span>1<span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span></span>2<span></span></a></sup> In a <a href="?title=Quality_control">quality control</a> procedure, a process is said to be at an acceptable quality level if the appropriate statistic used to construct a <a href="?title=Control_chart">control chart</a> does not fall outside the bounds of the acceptable quality limits. Otherwise, the process is said to be at a rejectable control level.</p>
<p>The usage of the abbreviation <b>AQL</b> for the term <b>Acceptable Quality Level</b> has recently been changed in the standards issued by at least one national <a href="?title=Standards_organization">standards organization</a> (<a href="?title=American_National_Standards_Institute" title="American National Standards Institute">ANSI</a>/<a href="?title=American_Society_for_Quality" title="American Society for Quality">ASQ</a>) to relate to the term <b>Acceptance Quality Level</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span></span>3<span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span></span>4<span></span></a></sup> It is unclear whether this interpretation will be brought into general usage, but the underlying meaning remains the same.</p>
<p>An acceptable quality level is an inspection standard describing the maximum number of defects that could be considered acceptable during the <a href="?title=Random_sampling" class="mw-redirect" title="Random sampling">random sampling</a> of an inspection. The defects found during inspection are sometimes classified into three levels: critical, major and minor. Critical defects are those that render the product unsafe or hazardous for the end user or that contravene mandatory regulations. Major defects can result in the product's failure, reducing its marketability, <a href="?title=Usability">usability</a> or <a href="?title=Saleability">saleability</a>. Lastly, minor defects do not affect the product's marketability or usability, but represent <a href="?title=Workmanship">workmanship</a> defects that make the product fall short of defined quality standards. Different companies maintain different interpretations of each defect type. In order to avoid argument, buyers and sellers agree on an AQL standard, chosen according to the level of <a href="?title=Risk">risk</a> each party assumes, which they use as a reference during pre-shipment inspection.</p>
