<SMALL>We have a chessboard with the two opposing corners removed,so that
there are only 62 squares remaining.Now we take 31 dominoes shaped such that
each domino covers exactly two squares. The question is:is it possible to
arrange the 31 dominoes so that they cover all 62 squares on the
chessboard?</SMALL><BR>

<SMALL>There are two approaches to the problem: <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><B>(1) The scientific approach </B></FONT><BR>
The scientist would try to solve the problem by experimenting,and after trying
out a few dozen arrangements would discover that they all fail.Eventually
the scientist believes that there is enough evidence to say that the board
cannot be covered.However,the scientist can never be sure that this is truly
the case because there might be some arrangement which has not been tried
which might do the trick.There are millions of different arrangements and
it is only possible to explore a small fraction of them.The conclusion that
the task is impossible is a theory based on experiment,but the scientist
will have to live with the prospect that one day the theory may be overturned.
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><B>(2) The mathematical approach </B></FONT><BR>
<A NAME="Logic">The</A> mathematician tries to answer the question by developing
a <A HREF="ptlytrue.html#Logic">logical </A>argument which will derive a
conclusion which is undoubtedly correct and which will remain unchallenged
forever.One such argument is the following: <BR>
* The corners which were removed from the chessboard were both white.Therefore
there are now 32 black squares and only 30 white squares. <BR>
* Each domino covers two neighbouring squares,and neighbouring squares are
always different in colour,ie one black and one white. <BR>
* Therefore,no matter how they are arranged,the first 30 dominoes laid on
the board,must cover 30 white squares and 30 black squares. <BR>
*Consequently,this will always leave you with one domino and two black squares
remaining. <BR>
*But remember all dominoes cover two neighbouring squares,and neighbouring
squares are opposite in colour.However,the two squares remaining are the
same colour and so they cannot both be covered by the one remaining
domino.Therefore,covering the board is impossible!</SMALL>

Chess</B></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><BR>
The game of chess involves a number of pieces and a board ruled into squares.
Moves in the game take place at discrete time intervals, according to the
laws of the game. Numerical weather-prediction is like a huge game of three
- dimensional chess. Imagine a fine grid of points drawn on the surface of
the Earth, at several heights to track the up - down motion of the atmosphere
as well as north-south and east west. This is the chessboard. The weather
now is described by assigning, to each grid point, several numerical values:
pressure, temperature, humidity, wind-speed. These are the chess-pieces.
The weather tomorrow also corresponds to a position in the game but the
disposition of the pieces is different. "Cyclone to Queen's Knight743." "
Blizzard to King's Lynn, Showers with Sunny Intervals to Bishop's Stortford."
We can measure today's weather using meteorological stations, ships, weather-
balloons, and satellite pictures. So we know how to set up the pieces. The
main question is, what are the rules of the game? The rules are the equations
of motion of the atmosphere. As we saw, these were found centuries ago by
the likes of Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli. By letting time flow in
tiny discrete steps, say one second long, the equations can be viewed as
rules telling us how to get from the position now to the position in one
second's time. Predicting the weather one second ahead may not sound a practical
contribution to the weighty problems of human kind, but that's just one move
in the game. Repeat the calculation, and you have the weather two seconds
into the future. After 86,400 iterations, you'll know the weather a day from
now. After 8,640,000 you'll know the weather a hundred days from now. After
8,640,000,000 . . . And in essence that's how it's done. Thousands upon thousands
of repetitive calculations based on explicit and deterministic rules.Just
what the computer is good at. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><B>Twixt Zero and Infinity</B></FONT><BR>
There's a philosophical curiosity involved in all this. The atmosphere isn't
really a perfectly divisible continuum; it's a lot of fairly solid little
atoms charging around like lunatics crashing into each other. The equations
of smooth ideal classical mechanics replace this discrete physical reality
by a fluid. But in order to solve those equations we approximate them by
something discrete again. We let time click ahead in tiny steps,continuously,
and we divide space up into a fine grid. This is forced by the structure
of computers: they can only do arithmetic to some definite number of decimal
places, say ten, in which case everything is an integer multiple of 0.0000000001.
To represent an infinite decimal exactly requires an infinite amount of computer
memory, which isn't feasible. The philosophical point is that the discrete
computer model we end up with is not the same as the discrete model given
by atomic physics. But there's a very practical reason for this: the number
of variables involved in the atomic model is far too large for a computer
to handle. It can't track each individual atom of the atmosphere.

can work with a small number of particles. <B>Continuum mechanics can work
with infinitely many. Zero or infinity. </B>Mother Nature slips neatly into
the gap between the two. So we do the best we can. Mathematicians hope that
this double approximation provides answers that are close to the real thing.
There are no substantial theoretical proofs that this is so; but there's
compelling evidence that it works. Until some genius develops new theoretical
tools, we accept the miracle and plough ahead regardless. It is, however,
worth remembering that when you "put the problem on the computer" you do
nothing of the kind: you represent some idealization of the problem in the
computer. This is one reason why the computer cannot be a universal palliative
for the ills of science and society. It just isn't clever enough yet.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><B>Falsifiability</B></FONT><BR>
In science,there's a time honoured way to find out whether a theory is right.
Experiment.<BR>
More accurately,an experiment can tell you whether a theory is
<I>wrong</I>,for you can never be absolutely certain that it's right.You
can prove a theorem in mathematics,but you can't prove a&nbsp;theory. As
the <A NAME="Popper">philosopher</A> <A HREF="idea1.html#Popper">Karl Popper
</A>emphasized,testing a scientific theory is a matter
of&nbsp;<I><A HREF="world/world55.rtf">falsification</A></I>,not
<I>verification</I>.<BR>
The more a theory fails to be falsified when confronted by experiment,the
more likely it is to be true;or at least the broader the range of conditions
under which it works.But you can never be certain the theory is absolutely
correct,even if it survives a million experimental tests;for -who knows?
-it may fail at the million and first.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Cause">To</A> count as scientific,<B>a theory must in principle
be falsifiable</B>.On the island of Corfu,there's a superstition that if
you see a praying mantis,it either brings you good luck -&nbsp;or bad
luck,depending on what happens.This belief doesn't amount to&nbsp;a scientific
theory;not because you can't measure "luck",but because it's hard to see
how an experiment could disprove the theory even if you could.<BR>
None of this means that the inhabitants of Corfu are wrong. What we're discussing
is the limits on scientific knowledge. There may be true things in the universe
that cannot be known in the scientific sense.However,it's going to be hard
to resolve disputes about them.<BR>
<BR>
"Does God Play Dice?" <A HREF="refer.html#S1">Ian Stewart</A> (p164) <BR>
<BR>
[Upon&nbsp;this basis,belief in God or any other superstition is rather like
belief in the capacity of a praying mantis to provide good or bad luck.The
idea is somewhat tautological,the luck will happen anyway,regardless of a
praying mantis being behind it,and so the mantis is nothing to do with the
<A HREF="refer.html#C2">cause and effect</A>.<BR>
&nbsp;Evolution has been around for ages and has withstood every stone thrown
at it,thus increasing the likelihood that it is right.Every attempt at falsifying
it has failed.Evolution wasn't assumed to be true in the first instance,it
has grown to be more likely to be true over time.Belief in God or any other
mysticism assumes the truth of the statement in the first instance,and claims
it as the truth until such time as counter-evidence is found.This inverts
the scientific scenario of how a&nbsp;theory builds it's reputation.Mystics
assume the reputation of their belief first and then have to have it
denied.<BR>
</FONT>
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<FONT size=2>Bizarrely the likes of <A HREF="iotm.html">Russell Stannard
</A>attempt to perform experiments on beliefs in God to try to assert their
validity,at least he is trying to use the scientific method the right way
around.Mystics assume cause and effect with no proof, rather as the inhabitants
of Corfu do with mantis,and even if counter evidence or lack of evidence
undermines that position,they hold onto it anyway,regardless of&nbsp;whether
it is valid.As Ian Stewart suggests in his book,there could very well be
an invisible monster creating the observed chaos in the universe,but we have
no evidence for such a creature,and any theory of invisible monsters would
have to hold it's own over time and prove itself as one attempted to falsify
it,assuming that it was,in principle falsifiable.<BR>
&nbsp;By comparison,mystics would assume that an invisible monster was there,and
performed actions in&nbsp;the world,with no evidence to show that a monster
was indeed the cause,and when the monster theory was falsified,would still
adhere to that theory even though it was wrong,or as with the people of Corfu
at least be in the position of not being able to be proved correct,and are
thus just as likely to be incorrect.Likewise with God and other beliefs,one
cannot show either conclusive evidence for or against,and thus there is no
reason to believe with great conviction something which has so little
credence.<BR>

<FONT size=2>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="graphics/chess/RUTGER.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="170"
    ALIGN="Left" ALT="Roy meets his maker by playing chess"><BR>
Even if one had a "theory of God",such a theory would have to stand the same
sort of scrutiny that a scientific theory does.As with Russell Stannard one
is forced into a farcical scenario of second guessing God and what things
an omnipotent deity will or won't do or be capable of,or assuming that such
a being will be at your beckoning.Whichever way you look at it, unsubstantiated
belief is a farce,you just can't win. You can't prove anything, and you can't
prove anything wrong. Thus there is just no point in doing it. Notwithstanding
the plethora of evidence in&nbsp;Nature of adaptation and change which shows
that evolution is going on,denying that it is makes no sense,if one is doing
it purely on the basis of a&nbsp;convicted belief.As Ian says,such things
as evolution are "theories" and as such cannot be 100% true,so any such theory
cannot represent a direct assault on a&nbsp;convicted belief by being "proved
correct".<BR>
&nbsp;The view that seeks to keep evolution out of the classroom is thus
misinformed about the nature of a scientific theory.It is not a&nbsp;threat
to a convicted belief. Any sane person though,would actually think that any
premise would need evidence to support it and have cause and effect shown.This
is not done in the case of superstitious belief. <BR>
For the above reason,belief in God cannot be proved true or false,whereas
a theory such as evolution can show itself to have pertinence as time goes
on,so if they are to be taught alongside each other,if anything evolution
has a greater claim to be taught,since at least it has evidence to support
it,whereas belief in "invisible monsters" does not,and can't have any positive
evidence that it is true. -LB]<BR>

    <TD><FONT size=1>A SHORTCUT THROUGH TIME: THE PATH TO THE QUANTUM COMPUTER
      by George Johnson<BR>
      In the 1960s Gordon Moore made the empirical observation that the density
      of components on a chip was doubling roughly every 18 months. Over the past
      40 years, Moore's law has continued to hold. These doublings in chip density
      explain why today's personal computers are as powerful as those that only
      governments and large corporations possessed just a couple decades ago. But
      in 10 to 20 years each transistor will have shrunk to atomic size, and Moore's
      law, which is based on current silicon technology, is expected to end. This
      prospect drives the search for entirely new technologies, and one major candidate
      is a quantum computer--that is, a computer based on the principles of quantum
      mechanics. There is another motive for studying quantum computers. The
      functioning of such a device, which lies at the intersection of quantum
      mechanics, computer science and mathematics, has aroused great intellectual
      curiosity.

The creator of Fritz's program, Frans Morsch, a Dutchman, input the coordinates
of Nijboer's move on a keyboard. Within seconds the computer delivered its
response. Nijboer had barely time to put his glass down. A black pawn moved
forward to block his white adversary. <BR>
The move was relayed simultaneously on Fritz's screen and a television monitor
watched by the audience. Morsch then duplicated Fritz's move on the chessboard
in front of Nijboer and sat back to wait. <BR>
Fritz is the first computer ever allowed to compete in a national championship
and the move has appalled traditionalists and many of the world's leading
players, including Britain's Nigel Short, a former world championship
finalist.<BR>
They argue that national tournaments are about man versus man, not man versus
machine. And they are horrified by the prospect of a computer being the chess
champion of the Netherlands, one of the stronger chess-playing nations -
by Friday night Fritz was joint second with six games to play. <BR>
The games are being played on six tables on the stage of Rotterdam's Library
Theatre. Five tables have two human competitors each. The one on the left
has Nijboer and the computer. <BR>
An audience of about 40 looks on, copying the players' monastic silence and
following every move on six screens. The auditorium is dimly lit but spotlights
beam on to the tables. <BR>
Fritz's presence has altered the mood of the tournament. Another grand master,
Paul van der Sterren, has boycotted it, while Manuel Bosboom resigned in
protest after four moves of his game against Fritz. Computers don't belong
here," he said. They are ugly and absurd." <BR>
Others are playing on and, despite the complaints, are curious about their
electronic rival. When they rise for a break most drift towards Fritz's table
to check proceedings. The computer was named by its German marketing company.
The blurb refers to Fritz having been "born in Hamburg in November 1991"
and lists its parents as Morsch, Matthias Feist and Matthias
W&uuml;llenweber.<BR>
The computer terminal is only the top half of Fritz. The rest is hidden below
the stage. The package includes four powerful processors containing a huge
database on all the participants in the championships, along with a large
store of game openings and endgame strategies. <BR>
The speed of its responses can be demoralising. The talented Jeroen Piket,
31, who has twice beaten <A HREF="7th-st.html">Garry Kasparov </A>and drew
with Fritz last week, said: "I'd spend 15 minutes deciding on a move, then
he'd reply in a few seconds. It's a bit shocking." <BR>
The players accept that computers have an important role to play in helping
people learn the game and prepare for matches. But they say machines have
unfair advantages in top-level tournaments. <BR>
Fritz has a record of all the moves played by his opponents in their previous
matches, enabling him to work out how they are likely to respond to his moves.
The human players can study opponents' past strategies before a game but
not during it. <BR>
There are other crucial factors. Fritz never tires, his mood is never affected
by a bad night's sleep or a row with his wife and he is impervious to
psychological warfare. <BR>
The Dutch Chess federation is backing Fritz. A spokesman said the computer
had generated interest in chess and increased the prize money by &#163;19,500,
to &#163;43,750. <BR>
Morsch said it was "absolutely right" to pit him against humans. Five years
ago they couldn't do it and in another five years they will be too fast for
humans. Now is the time when it makes for interesting matches." <BR>
But Nigel Short, a world championship finalist against Garry Kasparov in
1993, said: "The Dutch Chess Federation must have gone completely nuts. You
wouldn't let power boat compete in a swimming event or a forklift truck in
a weight lifting competition." <BR>
Fritz's enemies have at least one consolation: if he wins will not be allowed
to take home the prize money.<BR>

      played simultaneously.<BR>
      Jonathan played 150 games in nine hours, winning 137, drawing 12 and losing

      <FONT size=2>In the spring of 1770, an extraordinary mechanical man known
      as "The Turk" made his debut at the imperial court in Vienna. He was fashioned
      from wood, powered by clockwork and dressed in a stylish Turkish costume.
      His inventor, a 35-year-old Hungarian civil servant by the name of Wolfgang
      von Kempelen, boasted that The Turk could beat anyone at chess, an incredible
      proposition in an era long before the advent of computers. Kempelen had no
      plans for his chess-playing machine other than to amuse the court. He could
      have no idea that his automaton would achieve fame throughout Europe and
      America, that figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Edgar Allan Poe would
      become fascinated by it, and that the mystery of how The Turk worked would
      remain unsolved for almost 90 years.<BR>

	</TR>
      </TABLE>
      <P>
      <FONT size=2> When the Empress Maria Theresa indicated, at The Turk's inaugural
      appearance, that Kempelen should begin, he wheeled his automaton forward.
      The life-size figure sat behind a wooden cabinet or counter three feet high,
      four feet wide and two-and-a-half feet deep, with a board screwed to its
      top. The whole contraption ran on four brass castors that not only let it
      move freely, but also raised it slightly off the floor so that the audience
      could see that there was nothing untoward going on beneath.<BR>
      In the style of a magician, Kempelen proceeded to put on a theatrical performance
      that would continue to amaze audiences for decades to come. He first opened
      a door on the left of the cabinet to show an elaborate mechanism of densely
      packed wheels, cogs, levers and clockwork machinery. Opening a corresponding
      door at the back, he held up a candle which was just visible through the
      machinery to the audience in front. He then shut these doors and opened two
      larger ones, revealing the other two-thirds of the cabinet. It was largely
      empty apart from a few metal wheels and cylinders, and two horizontal structures
      resembling quadrants. Again, the audience could see right through.<BR>
      Kempelen closed the doors, turned a large key in the cabinet to wind up a
      clockwork mechanism, and the mechanical Turk sprang into life, reaching out
      with its left arm to move forward one of the chess pieces. Every 10 or 12
      moves, Kempelen wound the key again - but apart from this he did not touch
      The Turk, who swiftly proceeded to defeat a number of courtiers. <BR>
      The Turk's sensational performance astonished and delighted the Empress and
      became the talk of Vienna. By the beginning of 1783 Kempelen was ready to
      take his invention on tour. In Paris, it played and won against Benjamin
      Franklin, the American statesman and scientist, who was a chess fanatic.
      It also played against Fran&ccedil;ois Andr&eacute; Danican Philidor, the
      best chess-player in Europe, and although The Turk lost, the match was a
      public relations triumph.<BR>
      The Turk's next stop was London. It is difficult to imagine an attraction
      more likely to appeal to Londoners of 1783, for the city was not only a great
      centre for chess, but was also renowned for its enthusiasm for public displays
      of technical marvels. When The Turk went on show in Savile Row, the people
      flocked to see it, even at the considerable sum of five shillings each.<BR>
      Not everyone was impressed. Philip Thicknesse, a wealthy gentleman, was
      absolutely certain that The Turk was a trick, because it was able to respond
      to its opponent's moves. Thicknesse published a pamphlet in which he declared
      that the real mover is concealed in the Counter". The operator could see
      what moves his opponents made, Thicknesse suggested, using a mirror attached
      to the ceiling. <BR>
      A year later, Kempelen returned to Vienna, packed The Turk away into wooden
      crates and turned his attention to his other inventions -including an ambitious
      attempt to build<A HREF="synth1.html"> a machine capable of imitating the
      human voice.</A> In 1804 he died, and thereafter The Turk was sold to an
      engineer and musician by the name of Johann Nepomuk Maelzel, who was keen
      to make money from displaying Kempelen's automaton in public.<BR>
      The Turk's most famous encounter during this period came in 1809, when it
      was shown to Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon's valet, Louis-Constant Wairy,
      wrote: "His Majesty took a chair, and sitting down opposite the automaton,
      said, laughing: 'Come on, comrade, here's to us two.' The automaton saluted
      and made a sign with the hand to the Emperor, as if to make him begin...
      The game opened, the Emperor made two or three moves, and then intentionally
      a false one. The automaton bowed, took up the piece and put it back in its
      place. His Majesty cheated a second time; the automaton saluted again, but
      confiscated the piece. 'That's right,' said His Majesty, and cheated a third
      time. Then the automaton shook its head, and passing its hand over the
      chessboard, upset the whole game. The Emperor complimented the mechanician
      highly."<BR>
      It was in London in 1819 that The Turk encountered its most cunning and
      perspicacious observer yet: a young man named Robert Willis. Willis, like
      many others before him, was convinced that The Turk was controlled by a hidden
      operator. However, he emphasised that he did not wish to detract from "the
      real merits of Mr Kempelen", adding that "a more than ordinary share of skill
      and ingenuity must have fallen to his lot, who could imagine and execute
      such a machine". Willis saw The Turk as a mechanical puzzle to be solved,
      rather than as a fraud to be uncovered. <BR>

      <FONT size=2> The basis of Willis's argument was the notion that no mechanism,
      however complex, could play chess: such a feat was, he declared, "the province
      of intellect alone". Yet just as Willis's pamphlet appeared, another young
      Englishman was coming to exactly the opposite conclusion: the computing pioneer
      <B>Charles Babbage</B>.<BR>
      Babbage first saw The Turk play in London in the spring of 1819. The following
      year, he challenged it to a game. "Played with the 'automaton," he wrote.
      "Automaton won in about an hour. He played "very cautiously - a trap door
      in the floor of the room was very evident just behind the figure."<BR>
      Babbage was certain the automaton was under human control, though he was
      not sure quite how. But he started to wonder whether a genuine chess-playing
      machine could, in fact, be built. In particular Babbage argued in his memoirs
      that a suitably powerful mechanical engine would be able to play games of
      skill such as noughts and crosses, draughts and even chess. He even sketched
      out a primitive <A HREF="algo.html">algorithm</A> or computer program, for
      playing board games with moveable pieces. His insights would lie at the heart
      of the development of computers in the 20th century, culminating in
      <A HREF="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/meet/html/d.3.html">Deep
      Blue</A>, the chess-playing supercomputer that is capable of analysing 200
      million positions every second, and which
      beat<A HREF="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/meet/html/d.1.html"> Garry
      Kasparov</A> in 1997.<BR>
      The Turk's appearances in London between 1818 and 1821 continued to inspire
      discussion about the possibility of machine intelligence, with Babbage arguing
      that <B>a machine capable of performing logical calculations was theoretically
      possible</B>, while Willis stated categorically that it was not. But Willis
      had not landed the knockout punch he had hoped to deliver, and his "explanation"
      of how The Turk worked did little to undermine its popularity.<BR>
      It wasn't until 1827 that Maelzel's game appeared to be up. An article in
      the <I>Federal Gazette</I>, an American newspaper, gave an account of two
      boys who claimed that they had climbed onto the roof of a shed next to Maelzel's
      current exhibition hall, and had seen him opening the top of The Turk's cabinet,
      and that a man had climbed out. Maelzel brushed off this suggestion, and
      later that month the <I>Gazette</I> stepped back from its original report.<BR>
      Only in January 1857 did a truly authoritative account of how The Turk worked
      finally appear. It was written by Silas Weir Mitchell, whose father had bought
      the machine almost 20 years earlier to satisfy his own curiosity about how
      it operated. The Turk was indeed controlled by an operator concealed inside
      the cabinet. The clockwork machinery visible on its
      <A Href="l-hand1.html">left-hand</A> side extended only a third of the way
      along, so that the operator could sit behind it When the exhibitor opened
      the door to show the machinery, the operator slid forward to the other end
      of the cabinet, pulling dummy machinery into position with a string. <BR>
      After the demonstration had finished, the operator could make himself comfortable
      and get ready to play. By the light of a small candle - the smoke was carried
      up a chimney-ike pipe to an aperture in the top of The Turk's turban -the
      operator fixed a chessboard in front of him. He then grasped a metal pointer
      which could be moved to point at any square on the internal chessboard. The
      pointer was connected to The Turk's arm via a system of levers called a
      pantograph, which could be used to position The Turk's arm with great precision.
      Whenever the pointer was positioned over a particular square, The Turk's
      hand would be positioned over the corresponding square of the external
      chessboard. The pointer could also be moved up and down, which caused The
      Turk to raise and lower its hand. And by twisting the end of the pointer,
      the fingers of The Turk's gloved left hand could be opened and closed. Each
      time he made a move, the operator moved the appropriate piece on his internal
      chessboard,and then directed The Turk's arm to move the corresponding piece
      on the external board. <BR>
      But how could the operator tell how his opponent had moved? The chessmen
      on the external board contained small but powerful magnets; and just under
      each square of the board was a small metal disc, suspended on a delicate
      - coiled wire. When a chessman was put down on a particular square, the disc
      underneath was attracted by the magnet hidden inside the chessman, and moved
      upwards to make contact with the underside, of the board. When the chessman
      was picked up, the disc fell away and wobbled for a few seconds, on its coiled
      wire. By watching the underside of the board, first for a descending and
      wobbling disc, and then for a disc suddenly moving upwards, the operator
      could work out which chessman had been moved on the external board. He could
      then make the corresponding move on his own board, and start considering
      his response. <BR>
      It seems likely that Kempelen used a series of operators, although their
      identities are unknown. In 1774, for example, Kempelen claimed that the automaton
      had been damaged on the way to a performance and that he would need a week
      or two to fix it. He also admitted that it had played very badly Presumably
      The Turk's operator at the time was not a strong player, and Kempelen wanted
      to buy time in which to find and train someone better. He was dearly able
      to engage a strong player for The Turk's subsequent European tour, since
      the automaton took on some of the finest players in Europe and lost only
      to the very best.<BR>
      The first of The Turk's operators whose name is known was Johann Allgaier,
      a Viennese chess master who operated the automaton on Maelzel's behalf. Another
      Maelzel operator was a French player, Boncourt, who on several occasions
      almost let the cat out of the bag by sneezing during a game. This prompted
      Maelzel to install a noisy spring, to cover up any future coughs and
      sneezes.<BR>
      After Maelzel's death in 1838, The Turk passed to Dr John Kearsley Mitchell
      (whose son, Silas, later revealed how it worked). Mitchell was an associate
      of the writer Edgar Allen Poe, who had seen The Turk three years previously
      and had written an article suggesting that it had a hidden operator. Mitchell
      was eager to know whether Poe had guessed correctly and raised the substantial
      sum of $400 to find out for himself. He then set up a club for afficionados,
      but soon discovered that interest waned once the mystery was explained, and
      decided to sell the automaton to the Chinese Museum in Philadelphia. Fourteen
      years later, there was a fire at the Chinese Museum. Silas Weir Mitchell
      arrived just too late to save The Turk from destruction. It is said that,
      amid the fire's crackling wood and shattering glass, he fancied he heard
      The Turk's last words - "<I>Echec!Echec!</I>" - as it was engulfed by the
      flames. </FONT>
