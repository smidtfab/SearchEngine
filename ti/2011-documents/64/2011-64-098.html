<i>The Turk</i>, strictly speaking, is not a chess book.&nbsp; Oh, plenty of 
chess authors have reviewed it, including
<a href="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/review335.pdf">Taylor Kingston</a> at 
Chess Cafe (pdf format), Alex Dunne at Correspondence Chess News, and
<a href="http://www.rochadekuppenheim.de/heco/ar0206.html">John Henderson</a> in 
The Scotsman (entry for June 26th) as well as plenty of non-chess sites, including

CNN.com</a>,
<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,687113,00.html">
The Guardian Unlimited</a>, and
<a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020826/misc/26chess.htm">US News and 
World Report</a>; there is even an audio interview with the author on
<a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/atc/20020513.atc.15.ram">National Public 
Radio</a>.&nbsp; It is also true that The Turk was a chess-playing automaton, 
and that the author knows how the pieces move.&nbsp; None of which makes it a 
book about chess.</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
&quot;On an autumn day in 1769, Wolfgang von Kempelen, a thirty-five-year-old 
Hungarian civil servant, was summoned to the imperial court in Vienna by Maria 
Theresa, empress of Austria-Hungary, to witness the performance of a visiting 
French conjuror.&nbsp; Kempelen was well versed in physics, mechanics, and 
hydraulics, and was a trusted servant of the empress.&nbsp; She had invited him 
on a whim because she wanted to see what an expert in scientific matters would 
make of the conjuror's tricks.&nbsp; Yet the performance was to change the 
course of Kempelen's life.&nbsp; It set in motion a chain of events that led him 
to construct an extraordinary machine: a mechanical man, dressed in an oriental 
costume, seated behind a wooden cabinet, and capable of playing chess.&quot;</p>

    </blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<img border="0" src="http://www.chessville.com/images/The%20Turk%202.jpg" align="right" width="110" height="140"></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
So begins the preface to this&nbsp; remarkable account of the famous Turk, the 
chess-playing automaton that was to astonish and delight not just the courts of 
Europe, but the commoners as well, on at least four continents before its final 
retirement.&nbsp; The general story of the Turk is already well known among most 
chess-players, including the &quot;secret&quot; behind the Turk's remarkable performances.&nbsp; Standage saves the revelations of exactly how 
the Turk accomplished its feats 
for the final chapters, and for those not yet familiar with the story, I shall 
follow suit.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
The feats themselves, however, were no secret.&nbsp; The Turk didn't just play a 
pre-programmed series of moves, like completing the Knight's Tour or &quot;solving&quot; 
chess puzzles, although it did those too.&nbsp; The amazing phenomenon of the 
Turk was that it could play against human opponents, and almost always win!&nbsp; 
It played regular games, it played either side (opponent's choice) of a set of 
endgame positions, it corrected it's opponent's illegal moves, it did things no 
other automaton was capable of even emulating.&nbsp; Standage writes, &quot;The 
Turk's sensational performance astonished and delighted the empress, and at her 
behest Kempelen and his automaton made many more appearances before additional 
members of the royal family, government ministers of both Austria-Hungary and 
foreign countries, and other eminent visitors to the court.&nbsp; Kempelen's 
extraordinary creation became the talk of Vienna, and it soon became more widely 
known as letters describing the automaton were published in newspapers and 
journals overseas.&quot;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
In the eighteenth century, automata and other mechanical devices were captivating 
the attention not just of the royal courts, but of people all over Europe.&nbsp; 
Soon the principles behind these devices would change all of their lives, and 
one wonders just how many witnesses to these mechanical marvels wondered 
themselves about the new age they were entering.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this did 
not become a focus of this book, leaving me wanting more about the industrial 
revolution which was to follow, but this was not a book on industry, either.&nbsp; Standage does, however, 
do an excellent job of grounding the Turk in it's historical context, including the 
development of automata,  how the Turk fit into that picture, and how it 
relates to us still today.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
Chapter one begins with the assertion that almost all modern technology, from 
computers to CD players, find their origins in the elaborate mechanical toys of 
which the Turk is representative.&nbsp; &quot;The first automata were essentially 
scaled-down versions of the elaborate mechanical clocks that adorned cathedrals 
across Europe from medieval times.&nbsp; As well as displaying the time, these 
clocks often had astronomical features (such as the phase of the moon) and, in 
some cases, entire mechanical theaters that sprang to life on particular 
occasions.&quot;&nbsp; From there Standage traces the development of automata up 
to the creation of the Turk.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
For it's creator, Wolfgang von Kempelen, the Turk was a means to an end.&nbsp; 
His  ambitions extended well beyond the Turk, to the creation of a machine which 
could reproduce human speech, but he needed money, and access to 
materials.&nbsp; In other words, he needed Royal patronage.&nbsp; One early writer about the 
Turk &quot;caused news of the automaton to spread throughout Europe, somewhat to Kempelen's embarrassment; he had not expected [the Turk] to cause such a 
sensation.&nbsp; He had, however, achieved his objective.&nbsp; For the 
ingenuity of the Turk so impressed [Maria Theresa, the empress of 
Austria-Hungary] that she recalled Kempelen from Banat and awarded him a 
generous additional allowance equal to his annual salary.&nbsp; More important, 
now that the Turk had proved Kempelen's engineering prowess, she gave him 
several engineering tasks to perform in addition to his court duties...The 
success of the Turk launched Kemelen's parallel career as an engineer and man of 
science, which he pursued in addition to his duties as a civil servant.&quot;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
Kempelen's work on the mechanism of human speech eventually established his 
reputation as the founder of the discipline known today as experimental 
phonetics.&nbsp; The last of his speaking machines survives in the Museum of 
Science and Technology in Munich.&nbsp; A copy of this machine was demonstrated 
in 1863 for an audience that included a young boy.&nbsp; That boy, inspired by 
the demonstration, set out to build his own speaking machine.&nbsp; In 1876 his 
research paid off, when that boy, Alexander Graham Bell, invented the telephone.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
Another young man who became inspired by the Turk and other automata was Charles 
Babbage.&nbsp; Babbage went on to achieve fame as the designer of a series of 
mechanical computers, elaborate machines capable of simulating logical 
calculation.&nbsp; Another of Babbage's machines was so complex that Standage 
says it was &quot;inarguably the earliest ancestor of the modern digital computer: it 
had direct mechanical equivalents of a modern computer's processor and memory.&quot;&nbsp; 
Standage points out that &quot;These machines, like the Turk, would be the subject of 
arguments about the possibility of machine intelligence.&quot;&nbsp; Babbage also 
tried to invent a chess-playing machine, and as a result of his efforts, &quot;the 
subjects of chess, intelligence, and computing were well on their way to 
becoming inextricably intertwined.&quot;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
From these beginnings, <i>The Turk</i> follows the trail of the chess-playing 
enigma as it traversed four continents, changing hands several times, and at 
last winding up in the hands of Johan Nepomuk Maelzel.&nbsp; It was Maelzel who 
brought the Turk to the Americas, where competition and ingenuity soon produced 
a rival - the American Chess Player, which was first displayed in 1827 at the 
American Museum in New York.&nbsp; Standage continues to follow the trail of the 
Turk all the way to its fiery end in 1854.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
While Standage's earlier work may have received criticism as &quot;largely 
anecdotal&quot; and lacking &quot;real research&quot;&nbsp; (however unjustifiably - he doesn't 
claim to be a historian, asserting his books to be popular works) <i>The Turk</i> 
is rife with the trappings of a well-researched historical account.&nbsp; There 
are six pages of notes, and six more documenting his sources.&nbsp; Standage did 
not rely solely on previous author's work, however, on which to base his 
account.&nbsp; Original correspondence with the holders of historical documents, 
as well as a personal visit to the workshop of a modern-day Kempelen are part of 
the effort that has helped to craft a story that is at once scholarly and 
personal.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
From the Empress of Austria-Hungary, to Benjamin Franklin, to Catherine the 
Great, to Napoleon Bonaparte, to Edgar Allen Poe, the Turk lived a long and 
prosperous life, full of adventure and excitement.&nbsp; It's legacy lives on 
today, and <i>The Turk</i> is an excellent read about our past and our future.&nbsp; 
Who knows where today's new &quot;toys&quot; might one day lead us?&nbsp; Take <i>The Turk</i> 
with you on vacation, or on the train, or set it on your bedside.&nbsp; It is 
sure to entertain and inform you.&nbsp; That's the kind of book it is, the kind 
I read twice - it was that enjoyable.</p>

with his wife Kirstin, and daughter, Ella.&nbsp; He studied engineering and computer theory at 
Dulwich College and Oxford University.&nbsp; After graduation he covered science 
and technology for a variety of newspapers and magazines, including <i>The 
Guardian</i>, <i>The Independent</i>, <i>Wired</i>, <i>FEED</i>, and <i>Prospect</i>.&nbsp; 
He has also appeared as a technology and new media pundit on BBC television and 
radio.&nbsp; Former Deputy Editor of the<i> Daily Telegraph�s</i> technology 
supplement &quot;Connected&quot;,&nbsp;Standage is now Technology Reporter for The Economist.&nbsp; <i>The Turk</i> 
is his third book, following on the heels of <i>The Victorian Internet: The 
Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-Line Pioneers</i> 
and <i>The Neptune File: A Story of Astronomical Rivalry and the Pioneers of 
Planet Hunting</i>.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">Interview questions and other pronouncements of the author from promotional 
materials supplied by the publisher:</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10"><font face="serif">I had a lot of fun writing it; it's a 
subject I've been interested in for many years. There have been books about the 
Turk before, but they have generally been aimed at chess enthusiasts, rather 
than the general audience for which this book is intended. It doesn't assume any 
knowledge of chess, and the complexities of the game itself are actually of 
little importance to the story. John Gaughan, a magician based in Los Angeles, 
has reconstructed the Turk, and discovered much new information about its 
operation in the process. I visited his workshop and was very fortunate that he 
agreed to share some of his findings with me. The result is, I believe, the most 
detailed account so far of the Turk's extraordinary story.</font></p>

    </blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">Q: When did you first 
hear about the Turk?</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">I 
can't remember exactly, but it was probably when I was a teenager, and I first 
got interested in artificial intelligence. I had a book called The Policeman's 
Beard is Half-Constructed, which contained poems and prose written by a computer 
program called Racter. I spent several months working on my own software to do 
the same sorts of things: hold conversations, construct sentences, write poems, 
and so on. I also wrote programs that could make logical deductions based on 
simple statements and generate horoscopes. I read around the subject of machine 
intelligence generally, and it was probably then that I first came across the 
Turk.</p>

    </blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">Q: What was it about the Turk's story that particularly 
interested you?</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">What 
appealed to me was the way in which this automaton prompted a debate, in the 
late 18th century, about whether a machine could think or not. I loved the idea 
that people were debating the possibility of thinking machines over 150 years 
before the first digital computers were built. We like to think that the 
&quot;artificial intelligence&quot; debate is a modern phenomenon, but it's not. I'm 
rather fond of collecting examples of this kind of thing-historical precursors 
of modern scientific and technological breakthroughs. My first book, The 
Victorian Internet, looked at the parallels between the telegraph networks of 
the 19th century and the modern Internet. My second book, The Neptune File, was 
about how the planet Neptune was detected in 1845 by mathematical analysis of 
its effects on other bodies-which is how astronomers are now detecting planets 
around other stars.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">Q: The Turk is a detective story as well as a book about 
the history of technology. How did you piece together the Turk's somewhat 
mysterious history?</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">The 
biggest problem was distinguishing fact from fiction. There are lots of myths 
and legends surrounding the Turk, many of which are routinely reported as fact. 
Even the Encyclopedia Britannica from 1911, my favorite snapshot of the 
Victorian worldview, has a completely erroneous explanation of its secret based 
on a story put about by the magician Robert-Houdin in the 19th century. Wolfgang 
von Kempelen, the Turk's creator, is almost universally referred to as a baron, 
but he wasn't one. This kind of thing happens repeatedly, so I had to go back to 
the original reports and work through them in chronological order to see what 
could be trusted. It was then possible to see mistakes and fabrications 
propagate from one account to another. I went back to old journals and sources 
in English, French, and German, and communicated with a researcher in Budapest, 
who translated excerpts from Hungarian sources into German for me. I also 
visited the Library Company of Philadelphia, which has a huge archive of 
Turk-related material. And I talked to the members of what I call the &quot;Turk 
mafia&quot;-a group of magicians, chess experts and academics, most of whom 
communicate with each other, and all of whom are passionately interested in the 
Turk and its story. I've even ended up bidding against members of the Turk mafia 
when Turk-related items come up for sale on eBay.</p>

    </blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">Q: Why were so many people prepared to believe that the 
Turk was genuine?</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">There 
seem to have been a number of reasons. The Turk's first visit to Paris, for 
example, coincided with the first public demonstration of a hot-air balloon by 
the Montgolfier brothers. If flying machines, which were supposedly impossible, 
could in fact be built, then why not a thinking machine? Mechanical technology 
was advancing quickly, the industrial revolution was getting started, and 
displays of mechanical toys of amazing complexity were very popular. The way in 
which the Turk was presented made a big difference too. John Gaughan, a Los 
Angeles magician, has reconstructed the Turk. And when you see it playing, even 
if you know the secret, it's really convincing. It seems to tap into a really 
fundamental human compulsion to believe that it's real.</p>

    </blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">Q: Do you believe a &quot;thinking machine&quot; will be possible 
any time soon?</p>

    <blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">It 
all depends how you define &quot;thinking&quot;. I go along with Alan Turing, the great 
British mathematician, who sidestepped this philosophical question with his 
&quot;Turing test&quot;: he defined a thinking machine as one that can convince someone 
that it is a human in a written question-and-answer session. In other words, for 
practical purposes, a machine that appears to be intelligent - that can answer 
questions, or drive a car in response to spoken directions, or whatever - is as 
good as a machine that is &quot;really&quot; intelligent. The philosophers can go off and 
argue about whether or not it's really thinking, or has a mind, or whatever, but 
from an engineering point of view it's what the machine can do that counts. I 
expect we'll see machines like this in the next few years: speech-driven PCs, 
personal assistants, that sort of thing. They will appear to be thinking. Will 
they be HAL-like artificial minds? No. But they'll still be useful.<br>
