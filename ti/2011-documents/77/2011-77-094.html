          <h1>GLSL Shader Development - Make Your Own Tool, Fool  </h1>
          <h5><span>Published: 03/28/2011</span> <span>Readers: 128</span></h5>
          <p>One of my many tasks for the MMO game company is working on a set of procedural natural material shaders. We have an enormous amount of territory in our game, with over 600 towns, some with as many as 900 buildings. There are only so many different buildings so most appear hundreds of times and each is identical. Our ground terrain is also really minimally different (made up of some multitextures) that no matter where you are it looks mostly the same. The goal is to build shaders to create unique materials that make things look different and less repetitive.</p>
          <p>The problem is there are no decent tools for OSX to develop shaders in, and even on the PC the choice is poor. So to have a decent tool to do this (relatively hard) work I figured I&#39;d write my own tool in Cocoa.</p>
          <p>I tried Lumina but had a hard time getting it to compile, and the UI is rather odd. ShaderMaker was terrible unstable. Apple&#39;s own OpenGL Shader Builder is minimal, apparently unloved at Apple, and continuously "lost" the render window. I finally complained to Apple&#39;s feedback page and offered to help. I got an email from a recruiter there but they require one to work in Cupertino and I refuse to leave Texas, I said no thanks. Which leaves me with making my own tool.</p>

          <h1>Fighting the Good War - Against MMO Cheaters  </h1>
          <h5><span>Published: 03/17/2011</span> <span>Readers: 643</span></h5>
          <p>Part of my job working for the MMO company is dealing with professional (and some amateur) game hackers. It&#39;s something every MMO company deals with. For some reason people are determined to play a different game than you designed and are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege. Of course there are people out there just as determined to sell these folks ways to get ahead of their fellow players.</p>
          <p>Like all arms races for every counter measure you come up someone out there is trying to counter it as well. That&#39;s makes it an interesting game to play assuming you like the competition.</p>
          <p>All companies have to consider who is hacking their games, how the hacks are invented, how they are distributed, who buys them and of course what happens at runtime. There are a lot of for-pay companies who sell anti cheat systems (PunkBuster et al.) and people who sell (and sometimes just give away) anti anti cheat systems.</p>

          <h1>Becoming An MMO Game Programmer </h1>
          <h5><span>Published: 03/13/2011</span> <span>Readers: 515</span></h5>
          <p>Over the past couple of years I have been working with a local company that has a MMO game with a long history (10 years) and a loyal almost insane but small audience. It&#39;s also been the one game I play regularly for most of those years. Even today I still play a bit every day despite working on the code as well.</p>
          <p>I won&#39;t mention the name explicitly but it&#39;s not hard to figure out.</p>
          <p>The code base is not exactly pleasant to work with, a mixture of mostly C, some C++, some javascript and some lua. Originally the game was developed by a mixed crew, some bright and some of dubious ability, all under a great deal of pressure to ship with the usual end result. Currently we have two client coders and one host coder plus me (and an intern). Despite these obvious handicaps the game continues to provide a living for the company, and an addiction for the customers. The code, however, is pretty much a nightmare.</p>

          <h1>Blog Redesign </h1>
          <h5><span>Published: 03/08/2011</span> <span>Readers: 391</span></h5>
          <p>Finally got some time to redesign this blog, still some things not complete but I thought it best to put it out.</p>
          <p>I do plan to post more again.</p>
          <p>The past couple of months saw enormous manual spam overrunning my ability to control it so I turned off comments for now. "Manspam" comes from people who are paid a pittance to add useless comments to sites in order to supposedly influence Google rankings. I guess it&#39;s a sign my site has some kind of juice but give me a break; I made sure nothing they posted really helped them at all. Maybe they will go away now.</p>

          <h1>Non Automated Blog Comment Spam Sucks </h1>
          <h5><span>Published: 01/05/2011</span> <span>Readers: 923</span></h5>
          <p>I tried to keep out robot generated blog spam from this blog and never suffered a problem with comment spam. Recently a huge crop of manually-entered spam has overrun this blog and I basically deleted all the comments from Dec 1 onwards.</p>
          <p>I bet Mechanical Turk is behind it, someone paying a penny or two to comment on blogs. Naturally everyone puts links in the comments which remain plain text and are useless and also puts links in the link field, which is nofollowed so not terribly useful either. Clearly the spam generators don&#39;t know that and don&#39;t care.</p>
          <p>The question is: how do you keep valid comments in but manual spam comments out? I thought of asking basic programming questions but I think if you don&#39;t have a lot of them, the comment spam director would simply mention the answers in their request for spam.</p>
