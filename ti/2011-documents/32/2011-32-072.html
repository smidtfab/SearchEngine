				<small>January 12, 2011 by Steve Jarrett</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Android from Google has to make some in roads into the Apple space to be taken as a serious competitor. Whilst the phone manufacturers have snapped up a free copy of Android to try and stave off Apples dominance of the Smart Phone and now Tablet markets, recent studies and our direct experience have shown that there is a way to go in any competitive burn off.</p>
<p>Additionally the Blackberry sales into Corporates remains strong, although they continue to lose both sales staff to Apple, and whole corporations. However on an individual level, senior figures in Financial Markets organisations are beginning to question and challenge the corporate take that they can&#8217;t use their Apple device at work.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>
<p>- Android has a way to go technically to catch Apple&#8217;s IOS, especially since release 4. The IOS solution is consistent across all Apple devices and this means that use of the platform and development for it are far simpler on Apple, copy/paste works seamlessly across and within  apps, multi-tasking works without the user needing to be aware, switching apps is fast and simple and folders are  an effective solution to multiple groups of apps</p>
<p>- Blackberry are struggling to produce a tablet, due both to the complexity of this task, and the lack of available components due to Apple&#8217;s purchasing power for these core components.</p>
<p>- the often criticised approach to certify apps on Apple platforms means that Apple presents a consistent user experience across all applications. No relearning for users means rapid application take up. This is not the case to date on either the Blackberry or the Android devices.</p>
<p>- the bulk manufacturing approach for Android phones has meant significant hardware available to run the platform on. However  the physical build of the iPhone 4 and the iTouch, mean that the dual camera, retina display and wifi / 3G performance offer significantly better overall experience for the user, for a not significant uplift in cost, especially when on a phone contract.</p>
<p>Market research recently has shown that whilst the Android devices out sold Apple in the US domestic market the driver behind this was not device driven, but carrier driven. Verizon&#8217;s customers would not move to AT&amp;T for an iPhone.  Research indicates that now Verizon has the phone that the iPhone will outstrip Android in US domestic sales adding another 9m customers to the iPhone platform.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s dominance of the Smart Phone market continues to grow, and it looks likely in the immediate future to dominate the space. The Android market is too fragmented, and anyone that has used both platforms, as the author has, will quickly realise that the Apple user experience and applications base is so much better that it is difficult to see Android making up ground quickly. The Blackberry market is further fragmented, and as there are generations of Blackberry devices already in corporates, it becomes difficult to select which batch to support. (The IE6 problem all over again).</p>
<p>In addition Apple created and own the current tablet market. There seems to be a reluctance corporately to accept this, due to the management overheads and the difficulty of &#8220;owning&#8221; such a flexible platform as a corporation, but the user community in the finance houses is so significant now on a personal basis that this is likely to drive the acceptance corporately.</p>
<p>Those of us old enough to remember the original corporate reluctance to accept Microsofts dominance in the Office applications suite, and the push in many corporates to retain Notes for email and Lotus 123 for spreadsheets will remember the pressure from the user community to adopt Outlook and Excel. The users won.</p>
<p>worldflow believe that this is likely to happen in many organisations with the corporate adoption of Apples Smart Phone (iPhone) and in particular the Tablet (iPad) will be driven by a vast user appetite to use these devices for real work, and not just as a toy for their children. We see this in organisations daily, where senior staff members want to access the corporate networks, email, documents, on their personal Smart Phone or Tablet, and these are always Apples devices.</p>
<p>For use in applications space corporately the iPad in particular has a growing following, and none more so than the Financial Markets space. Research, Sales, Cash Management, Client Portfolios and so on are becoming common applications on this platform. Far sighted Financial organisations are following this trend and rolling out Apple devices as standard to their internal users.</p>
<p>As the internal community grows corporately, and personally, and as the clients of Investment houses look to their suppliers to provide content through Apple devices, so the market trend will continue towards Apple&#8217;s dominance of the space.</p>
<p>worldflow will continue to support and develop financial applications for the Apple, Blackberry and Android platforms, but as we currently observe the Financial Markets use of both Smart Phones and Tablets, it looks like Apple will dominate in this space. Things change in technology, but this trend could take a number of years to reverse, if it will reverse.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://worldflow.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/crowdsourcing-in-finance/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Crowdsourcing in&nbsp;Finance">Crowdsourcing in&nbsp;Finance</a></h2>
				<small>April 9, 2010 by Steve Jarrett</small>

					<p>Crowdsourcing has a number of definitions as you read the various Internet views of the potentials of this service.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Financial Services we, worldflow, define Crowdsourcing as the use of mass resources both internal and external to the company to provide ideas, effort or potential customers.</p>
<p>Utilising mass audiences to input to an idea, to add more resources or to prove and then potentially use your latest product is an obvious use of the Crowdsourcing concept.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t banks do this as a matter of policy? It is simple enough, there is a lack of understanding of the technologies involved, the internal teams working on the applications are internally focused and there is an inherent an overused security concern associated with most of the banks Internet efforts.</p>
<p>In order to pilot Crowdsourcing many major organisations can look internally first. In small companies, like worldflow, our first thought is to use our own resources first to test or pilot something, including all the departments we have.</p>
<p>When you are a multinational organisation this flexible approach seems to disappear, which eliminates a very large potential user base. In talking with some major clients, they can&#8217;t see initially how to break down the barriers to use the wider organisation. But if they were able to get past this, they have a significant user community who share the same ideals and company loyalty that they have.</p>
<p>It would also allow organisations to retain an element of security using the internal networks, and also confidentiality in terms of what they are doing.</p>
<p>In expanding to the outside world there is a serious issue, especially in today&#8217;s anti-finance climate. Why would anyone help a financial services organisation to develop further services?</p>
<p>Well obviously there are cost-effective ways around this that have been used by marketing companies for years.</p>
<p>1) The users are partaking in something revolutionary and they are the groundbreakers. Everyone else will be catching them up. Using and feeding back on mobile access services would fit well into this. Using a beta release before others is another example.</p>
<p>2) there is a direct incentive to the user such as the ability to get a free service once live, rewards for best performance (such as trading competitions on CFD platforms), or even a charitable donation on behalf of the individual if they partake.</p>
<p>3) For the greater good. Offering to expand any charity contribution through to the service actually being beneficial for emerging economies or a more green solution to financial services. worldflows&#8217; GME solution for accessible banking for emerging economies is an example where testing and development would benefit from proof in more developed economies.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly other incentives that would work, however without some form of incentive whether technical, financial or moral it is difficult to see why users would rush to sign up. Organisations need to be flexible enough to recognise this.</p>
<p>How Crowdsourcing could be deployed using internal or external crowds remains a key issue.</p>
<p>The answer is that with enough flexibility in am organisation and the capability to follow up with the community proactively this form of Resourcing can be used very effectively.</p>
<p>- getting feedback on ideas is straight forward. Polls can quickly be setup, and so can simple surveys. Organisations need to resist the desire to overload surveys and try and expand beyond the subject.</p>
<p>- collating green field ideas is a more difficult process. Original thinking is difficult in a crowd. Working through a set of ideas using combinations of polls and surveys can work, with ranked ideas within packages of similar ideas.</p>
<p>- testing is an underrated use of Crowdsourcing. There is a view that finance applications require expertise to test, bit are easy to use. Clearly this is a mutually exclusive argument. Testing new functionality should be very achievable, in addition to resolving the interminable performance and scaling test issues.</p>
<p>- manual effort can also be effectively Crowdsourced. Using teams to reconcile balance sheet changes, systems breaks, input data, do mass amends etc are all feasible. With a little imagination to obfuscate the true meaning of the data and two or even four eyes verification this type of process could be very effective.</p>
<p>These are generic examples of utilising the effects of crowds. One practical example worldflow were involved on for a bank was a trading competition for a CFD site. The prize was simple, an interview as a trader. The upside from the bank was the ability to add and test new products with the competitors, to volume test the system, and build up a base of potential customers for not only the trading platform but their other offerings.</p>
<p>The issue with Crowdsourcing is that of taking on legitimate users, and not missing the demographic or locations needed for an ideal group. This requires effective and carefully planned client take-on. Without this process to vet and manage the users, effectively log and track them, provide impetus to them during the process and track and feedback results to the users during the process they will soon lose interest. The level of MIS required both internally and externally for Crowdsourcing far exceeds that of traditional users.</p>
<p>With the right tools on place achieving a positive result from a Crowdsourcing, not only for the immediate exercise, but a genuine opportunity to build up a loyal set of users for future exercises and marketing initiatives.</p>
<p>For input on the use of Crowdsourcing and the tools required in your business don&#8217;t hesitate to contact worldflow for impartial and effective advice.</p>

					<p>worldflow have recently begun to examine the use and application of .tel domains in financial services.</p>
<p>On initial examination these domains have a striking resemblance to the invention of eternity rings by De Beers in the 1960’s.</p>
<p>Faced with declining sales and a glut of cheap small low quality diamonds from Russia, they had to invent a new way to sell these diamonds, to keep prices up. They went about this by packing many of these small diamonds into a single ring. Every woman who was married then became a new customer target for these rings, and every married man was pressured by the guilt of not declaring eternal love for their wife. Sales boomed, with the added bonus that the glut of produce they had was moved off the shelves and onto women’s fingers, and diamond’s stayed a rare and expensive commodity..</p>
<p>.tel bears a striking resembelnce from the outside to this type of marketing. We have declining domain sales, due to saturation and recession, domains are more available than for several years as firms fold. Additionally there is a a free cheap resource in the shape of the Domain Name Services (DNS).</p>
<p>So the marketing folks have invented the .tel domain. Not even a domain, much like Pluto is now not even a planet. So there is no email, web, forwarding, FTP etc associated with these .tel domains. Just a small DNS entry for each .tel domain.</p>
<p>The principal is every company, and indeed an individual needs a .tel DNS entry. They can then add them to a global directory that anyone can look up. This then becomes a way to store the companies contact details. The basics are company name, description, contact names (limited), web address and phone numbers.</p>
<p>Using the tools supplied free from telnic.org, including iphone and Blackberry utilities, the company can set this data up and then add the .tel domain to their web site, business cards, and hopefully begin to appear in the next generation of online directories to browse .tel entries.</p>
<p>worldflow have setup our .tel domain. Type worldflow.tel into the address bar on your browser. Having tried this on IE6, Firefox, Safari and a Nokia N97 and the formatting looks fine. However as at today, we haven’t managed to pull up folders we setup to further describe the organisation. And ours is a fairly small organisation.</p>
<p>worldflow are working to understand the wider use of the .tel domain, if there is one. If there is one we will find it.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the initial implementations are very basic. For an individual, or a SME this looks like it may add some value. But not much above just typing the name into Google.</p>
<p>The structures as exposed from DNS to the external world are currently not obviously scalable to a larger organisation.</p>
<p>We haven’t had the time yet to look at the secure nature of these offerings. They appear controlled, but at present the access control is a simple name / password combination which will not scale for larger organisations either.</p>
<p>Once the global directories are there, the depth (number of entries) of the product expands, and the ability to control access effectively to administration and browsing restrictions, the information could be quite valuable. Right now, although we have been active on .tel domains for a couple of weeks, and we do not appear in the sample directories yet. So this is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>An eternity ring won’t solve a bad marriage; but it might help longer term to pull you closer to your chosen one. And ultimately could save you the costs of a divorce.</p>
<p>Your .tel domain won’t add a huge amount of value to your company yet. But if someone else has it, by the time the value is realisable, you will be unable to realise it.</p>
<p>For now, register your .tel while it’s still there. Or you could end up spending a lot more trying to get it back from someone else, once you figure out what it can be used for..</p>
<p>For advice on this or any other concerns around your web presence, client connectivity or other financial services issues please contact us.</p>

				<small>February 27, 2010 by Steve Jarrett</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In exploring the use of several channels to better connect with our clients, and our clients clients, it is clear that the explosion of tools and simple global access to the channels provides several exciting opportunities.</p>
<p>The issue remains, as with any media from newsprint through the web sites and to the Tweets and the Blogs is to how to get your clients to take any notice of the channels you provide.</p>
<p>Where is the imperative for the client to come and look at the output that is so carefully prepared. As we produce increasingly complex and varied content, how do we get the clients to read what is output. The social networks draw customers back day in day out. What can be provided to the finance community to draw them day in day out.</p>
<p>The consolidation of several sources. Genuine new and enlightening insight. Tools that make life easier. </p>
<p>This is the challenge we face. Having to select and drive this content in a way that is at once immediately appealing and also drives repetitive behavior to return and review the output is critical.</p>
<p>We at worldflow don&#8217;t have the answer to the problems yet. But we are working on understanding the capability of the tools well enough to provide channel options to our client base, while we continue to seek the answer through the right combination of facilities.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that there is no one answer. Each client or set of similar clients will want different aspects of a rounded solution. One thing is certain. The facilities can be put into place within the wider context of the web, mobile services, IP telephony, video broadcast, podcasting and other media. </p>
<p>Tailoring them to meet the client facing requirements is the challenge. And one worldflow is focused on solving.</p>
