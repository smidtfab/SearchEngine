				<p><em>Each day,&nbsp;</em>Inc.&#039;s<em>&nbsp;reporters scour the Web for the most important and interesting news to entrepreneurs. Here&#039;s what we found today:</em></p>
<p><b>Larry Ellison takes Google to court</b>. It&#039;s been a bad week for Google. Today, the Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is suing the search company for copyright and patent infringement, casting &#8220;a legal cloud over the growing number of cellphones that use the Android operating system.&#8221; The lawsuit alleges that the Android operating system improperly uses Java software owned by Sun Microsystems, which Oracle purchased earlier this year. The drama, which pits Oracle&#039;s brash founder Larry Ellison against Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is bad news for the growing number of app developers because &#8220;an Oracle injunction could block developers from building applications and shipments of Android phones,&#8221; according to the article. Meanwhile, earlier this week Google&#039;s seeming walk-back on net neutrality (at least for the mobile Internet) caused start-ups to cry foul.</p>
<p><b>Meet the 16-year-old millionaire.</b> Christian Owens is a humble British teen from Northamptonshire who&#039;s been computing since age 7. He&#039;s inspired by Steve Jobs, and has made nearly $2 million. How&#039;d he do it? He set up a website at age 14 that sold bundles of neat Mac OS X applications for a limited time and for a tenth of their regular price, Gizmodo reports. It had almost a Groupon-esque word-of-mouth promotion, because if enough people purchased the bundle, a new app would be unlocked for everyone who purchased it. He also gave to charity. Anyway, Owens is now working on Branchr, a pay-per-click advertising company that has already made $800,000 in its first year. A star employee? Christian&#039;s 43-year-old mum, Alison.</p>
<p><b>Beating back the counterfeiters.</b> They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in the business world, you&#039;d rather have your flattery in forms other than copycatting. That&#039;s the case for Vibram FiveFingers, an Italian company that started making &#8220;barefoot&#8221; shoes, the glove-like toe-separating running shoes that have become a health and fitness trend. While the company&#039;s revenue shot up from $430,000 in 2006 to $11 million last year, it costs the company $2,500 in legal fees to shut down each of more than 200 fake Vibram sites that have popped up all over the Web, CNN Money reports. &#8220;It&#039;s like Whack-a-Mole,&#8221; says Georgia Shaw, a marketing associate at the company. &#8220;It&#039;s become a really huge problem, taking a lot of our time and energy.&#8221; The company is working with Google to stifle the paid search ads for these knockoff sites and hiring an investigator to look into Chinese factories duplicating their brand. Here are some strategies for keeping tabs on the competition.</p>
<p><b>Mixing business with politics.</b> Target&#039;s recent donation to a conservative gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota is damaging both its reputation and opportunities for growth. After the Supreme Court eliminated the ban on corporate election donations earlier this year, the AP reports that Target contributed $150,000 to back Republican Tom Emmer&#039;s campaign. Now, gay rights organizations, including Human Rights Campaign, are boycotting the corporation for supporting Emmer, who staunchly opposes gay marriage, and Target&#039;s plans to open two stores in San Francisco are in question. One San Francisco supervisor tells the AP, &#8220;It just illustrates their disconnect, I think, from a city that they would want to establish a successful business in,&#8221; which she refers to as &#8220;the epicenter of the LGBT rights movement.&#8221; Target is now in talks with HRC to negotiate an equal donation to &#8220;gay-friendly candidates.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Your business has accumulated an e-mail list, but you have no idea how to connect those e-mail subscribers to your Facebook page, your Twitter followers and other social networks. You&rsquo;re looking for a relationship with those customers, maybe something more than responses to your marketing e-mails. Enter Flowtown.com. </p>
<p>Co-Founder Ethan Bloch started his first business at 13, using IRC (Internet Relay Chat &ndash; the grandfather of Twitter and Instant Messaging) to directly market the products from his electronics ecommerce site. Ethan offered Playstation and Dreamcast accessories during the summer of 1999, and was successful competing on price for 6 months. Then suddenly, he lost all his customers because someone had created a similar website with better prices. Bloch learned at that moment about the value of creating customer relationships. </p>
<p>Fast-forward 10 years, and Bloch, formerly the host of the Internet video show WSYK (What Should You Know) and his cofounder Dan Martel, a Canadian long-time entrepreneur, launched the company. Flowtown is simple tool that allows you to run a list of e-mails and obtain the connected accounts on  Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, LinkedIn and more than 40 other networks. You can then communicate with the people from your list on those networks as well. </p>
<p>Additionally, you can learn your list&rsquo;s demographics, geographic characteristics, and the subscribers&rsquo; influence ranking.&nbsp; &ldquo;We reached out to these influencers directly via Facebook,&rdquo; said Meaghan Edelstein, Social Media Director of Smashyn.com. &ldquo;We said &#039;We see you&rsquo;re a customer who has purchased before and we&rsquo;d love to hear what you think, and we&rsquo;d encourage you to like and link to our customer&rsquo;s page on your own page.&#039; Everyone that we reached out to did this &#8211; quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another feature Flowtown enables is parsing your incoming e-mail subscribers, to see if they meet certain criteria, and flagging them.&nbsp; (Flowtown can be integrated with e-mail services iContact, MailChimp and Campaign Monitor as well as form creator Wufoo.). So if a person with a million Twitter followers joins your list, you will find out about it when it happens. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We push these demographic stories into these mail tools &ndash; so they can help you create segmented lists based on gender, age, location and social network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How would you start such a communication without making your customers feel like you were spamming them on Social Networks? Edelstein told me that her firm used Flowtown for their client Natural Skin Shop. </p>
<p>&ldquo;With our first outreach, the client increased the &#8220;Likes&#8221; on their Facebook Page by over 50%.&nbsp; Further, we sent out a campaign to all the customers who were on Facebook asking them to post on the Fan Page wall why they love Natural Skin Shop. In less than 24 hours around 200 posts from customers showed up on the wall. Twitter followers increased as well but not by as much. However, the number of people who purchase products from natural Skin Shop via Twitter has increased significantly.&rdquo; <br />What kind of return on investment did they achieve? Flowtown can cost a few dollars a month plus about 4.5 cents to import each user. Bloch says &ldquo;If you can get one influential person to blog about you, it should generate more marketing attention than the $450 you would spend on Flowtown for&nbsp; importing 10,000 users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bloch emphasizes that &ldquo;Connecting with customers on Social Networks shouldn&rsquo;t replace your e-mail marketing efforts &ndash; rather it should compliment them. If you&rsquo;re a bakery in the MidWest, you might send e-mail news once a month. What Flowtown will do is help you understand what you should be saying, and to whom, since now you know a lot more about your subscribers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Additionally, if you analyze your list and see you have a lot of Facebook users but few are on Twitter, you know where to concentrate your social outreach efforts. </p>
<p>The way small businesses connect to customers is changing, and Flowtown seems like a useful tool in a marketer&rsquo;s up-to-date arsenal. What are you using to find and connect with customers? Share your tips below.</p>

				<p>As one of the founders of the original Napster and CloudMark (an anti-spam service), Jordan Ritter, has always been fascinated by the idea of combining the power of the cloud and the potential of human capital. Last April, he met up with Alex Edelstein, a former CloudMark executive, to hammer out their next business plan.</p>
<p>Over a round of beers, the idea for CloudCrowd was born.</p>
<p>Like CrowdFlower and Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk, CloudCrowd is trying to bring labor into the cloud, by creating a vast network of workers around the globe. Today, there are roughly 25,000 workers, who have completed more than a million tasks since the site&#8217;s launch in October 2009. That represents a small fraction of CrowdFlower&#8217;s claim to 500,000 workers, but CEO Edelstein says their force is quickly expanding, with some 2,000 additions each week. Although it took 7 months to reach the one million task mark, Edelstein predicts they&#8217;ll reach 2 million jobs in 8 weeks. See video above.</p>
<p>CloudCrowd has two main segments. The bulk of its business is client-driven work: a company submits tasks to CloudCrowd and the service will farm that out to eligible workers. Workers access CloudCrowd through a Facebook app, where they can pick available tasks and arrange payment.The tasks can be as simple as checking the quality of an image or involve the translation of entire web pages. Because pricing is determined by the level of difficulty, the payouts range from one penny to several dollars. Once a task is completed, a different user will check the finished product for an additional fee, creating a level of quality control.</p>
<p>The second part of their business is a new layer of consumer-facing services.</p>
<p>CloudCrowd recently launched EditZen, a simple web site, where consumers can submit pages for editing at $4 a page. The company will soon launch TranslationZen, which will offer translation services at $19.95 a page (far cheaper than some alternatives which are priced at $60 a page).</p>
<p>Aside from their consumer services, CloudCrowd&#8217;s cut varies widely depending on the job&#8212; ranging from a 20% cut to as high as 80%. The average worker doesn&#8217;t get paid handsomely for their task, but it can be a nice source for supplemental income&#8212; especially for workers in developing countries where salaries are generally well below America&#8217;s mean. In fact, the company now attracts more workers outside of the US, with a heavy concentration in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (many from Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore).</p>
<p>The startup, which has yet to reach profitability, is a 15 person operation in San Francisco with modest funding. So far Edelstein is their sole investor, with $1.5 million in the project, but they are talking to major VC firms about a Series A round.</p>
<p>The main challenge for a company like CloudCrowd is keeping pace with its ever-growing workforce. Edelstein admits that feeding the machine with sufficient volume and variety is a difficult endeavor in this early stage. The company has not spent a significant amount of capital on marketing and courting clients, instead, CloudCrowd still relies on word of mouth to attract new business.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well it&#8217;s true that the number one complaint of our workers is give me more work, I want more availability of jobs. In both of the previous outsourcing, disruptive eras, the era of manufacturing moving to China and developing nations and the era of white collar work moving to India it took years of explaining, educating and showing corporations and all sorts of people who had work how much they could benefit&#8230;how consistent the work quality could be,&#8221; Edelstein says. &#8220;We don&#8217;t expect that overnight every single company in the Fortune 500 is going to outsource significant amounts of their work to the internet cloud but we&#8217;re sure that it&#8217;s going to happen over time.&#8221;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key to their success (and beating rivals like CrowdFlower) lies in the credibility of their workforce and amassing as much information as possible on the skills of their workers. According to Ritter, the system&nbsp; is structured to create dynamic profiles on each user. Every time a user completes a task and that task is reviewed, CloudCrowd will learn how reliable that user is and which skills they excel at. If all that information is organized properly, that could be highly valuable for a client who needs to finish a targeted task in a short time frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building sort of what we call the credibility graph of known reliable people on the internet,&#8221; Ritter says. &#8220;If there are particular customers who&#8230; say, &#8216;I want a thousand reliable people on the internet to do a particular job for me.&#8217; Well today you really can&#8217;t find that. Where would you find 1,000 reliable people on the internet.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: 11pt"> <b>Old Spice&rsquo;s marketing gimmick&mdash;a macho guy played with a wink by  Isaiah Mustafa&mdash;has reached a crescendo on TV and the Web. Tricia Romano  on the evolution of black male sex symbols.</b></span></span></p>
<p>From the moment the Old Spice commercial featuring Isaiah Mustafa aired in February America swooned. Who, we wanted to know, was this dashing, tall, dark and handsome figure with impossible abs, a gleaming smile, and a twinkle in his eyes? (Oh, yes, and riding on a horse. One mustn&#039;t forget the horse).</p>
<p>Mustafa quickly became a household face&mdash;if not name&mdash;as the original commercial eventually racked up 13 million views on YouTube.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="non-feed"><span class="PullQuote"> He&#039;s hot enough to make celebrity lesbian Ellen DeGeneres giggle like a school girl when he visited her set, causing her to beg him to recite his Old Spice lines. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Old Spice Guy Hangs Up His Towel</b></p>
<p>And this week, on the heels of its second installment in the series (featuring Mustafa swan diving into a jacuzzi and landing on a motorcycle), the company invited people to ask questions of &#8220;Old Spice Man&#8221; on Twitter which Mustafa answered in 30-second clips on YouTube. The result was an instant viral success&mdash;the Old Spice YouTube channel was ranked No. 1 on the website. (At least one person wasn&rsquo;t impressed: Sockington the cat&mdash;who has resisted using his popularity for commercial purposes&mdash;threw up his paw: &ldquo;HELLO @OLDSPICE much interest at your viral marketing campaign at sockington hq/litterbox I AM A CAT WITH 68 TIMES MORE FOLLOWERS discuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sockington&rsquo;s dissent aside, the success of the Old Spice commercials hinges not only on the clever, almost absurdist imagery and writing, but on Mustafa and his inherent sex appeal.</p>
<p>The Root argued this week in an essay called, &#8220;Why The Old Spice Guy Is Good For Black America&#8221; that &#8220;the success of the Old Spice Guy &#8230; might actually be a sign that being a black man in America is getting slightly easier.&#8221; Cord Jefferson points out that not so long ago, the black man&#039;s role in advertising was as a scary figure to contrast against the white so-called gentlemen; or more recently, as a subservient figure.</p>
<p>I&#039;ll go one further than Jefferson: The Old Spice Guy isn&#039;t just good for Black America, Mustafa&#039;s place in the pop culture pantheon is good for all of America.</p>
<p>As Farai Chideya, former NPR journalist and host of forthcoming radio show, Pop and Politics Radio, explained to me, &#8220;You have certain black actors who could sell things, but they usually did them in these nonsexual ways, like Bill Cosby and Jello. Then you had people who were sexual like Billy Dee Williams, who pitched a brand for a black audience,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is something new where it&#039;s for a mainstream, general mixed-race audience.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Caption: Mustafa filmed video responses to some of his lucky Twitter followers, including actress Alyssa Milano.</b></p>
<p>The choice of a black man as the desired sex object for a national advertising spot aimed at mainstream America, which is to say white America, is particularly perfect right now. It&#039;s hard to say whether Mustafa and Old Spice would have paired up 10 or 20 years ago, unless he was a famous star athlete like O.J. Simpson. One could argue that having a handsome black president has softened a lot of people&rsquo;s ideas of what&rsquo;s attractive and sexy&mdash;Obama&rsquo;s shaky polls notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Old Spice had another black spokesman before Mustafa: Terry Crews. The hyperactive ad series featured the ex-NFL linebacker topless and yelling in an intense (and funny) way. Chideya says of Crews: &#8220;He&#039;s not as handsome as Isaiah, but he&#039;s also really funny in a way that&#039;s more within the black vernacular.&#8221; Of Mustafa, she says, &#8220;This guy is no doubt black, but he&#039;s someone who is the modern, urbane, living-in-a-post-racial-Fort Greene kind of a guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Obama braves the fast-moving political tide (we love him, we are irritated and disappointed with him, we loathe him, we love him again), here is this other stunningly handsome, funny black man on our TV, transcending color lines, with&mdash;it should be noted&mdash;a Muslim name.</p>

<p><em>Hank Wasiak is a partner at the creative firm The Concept Farm, and the best selling author of the Asset-Based Thinking book series. He is a three-time Emmy award winning TV host, a teacher at USC&rsquo;s Graduate School of Business, and a Reiki Master.</em></p>
<p><span class="&#039;blippr-nobr&#039;">Social Media<span class="blippr-nobr"><span>social media</span></span></span> started out as a bit of a novelty &#8212; a playground for the &#8220;geekerati.&#8221;  But it has taken hold as a game changing force that will reshape advertising at its very core.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to move past debates about traditional media co-existing with social media. Madison Avenue should see social media as a wonderful, if not disruptive, gift. It should run hard to catch up with the consumer, let go of legacy business models and build something better.</p>
<p>My career in advertising started in February, 1965, right in the middle of the <i>Mad Men</i> era, and I am fortunate to still be doing what I love. Just when I thought I&rsquo;d seen everything over the past five decades, along came social media. Here I am at age 67, cheering for change and eager to be a part of it.</p>
<p>To put things into perspective, it&rsquo;s helpful to look back at the impact that TV had on the ad business in the mid 60s and draw some parallels with where we are today.</p>
<h2> That Was Then<br /></h2>
<p>When I arrived on Madison Avenue, the growth and expansion of television advertising was hitting its stride. An explosion of mass, controlled, &ldquo;broadcast out and shout&#8221; communications was changing the face, function and finances of advertising. Madison Avenue embraced these changes in a big way and leveraged the power of television to launch a golden age of advertising.</p>
<p>Creative people started seeing short-message story telling as a valued currency just as creative departments promoted collaboration between art directors and writers. TV production departments also grouped together producers, directors and technical specialists into collaborative teams.</p>
<p>The client/agency relationship deepened as agencies took on proactive roles.  Research also changed, and put more emphasis on measuring both the rational and emotional components of messaging.</p>
<p>In effect, a new breed of <i>Mad Men</i> emerged to start boutique agencies that fueled a creative revolution and brought a new value system to the business.</p>
<h2> The Seeds of Disruption<br /></h2>
<p>While TV ushered in a new era in advertising, the business aspect evolved and reshaped itself along relatively predictable lines. All of that changed with the <span class="&#039;blippr-nobr&#039;">Internet<span class="blippr-nobr"><span>Internet</span></span></span>, social media, and the rise of mobile devices.  This quote from Jim Farley, the CMO of Ford, sums up the sentiment in most C-suites today: &ldquo;We want to take that stupid little box we were forced into as advertisers, blow it up, and change the way we interact with the customer, and we want it to be around the experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for Madison Avenue to embrace these social marketing opportunities with the same enthusiasm it had for the disruptive change of television.</p>
<h2> This Is Now<br /></h2>
<p>Marketing has traditionally focused on the four &#8220;Ps&#8221;:  Product, Price, Place and Promotion.  Social media has morphed into the fifth, and possibly most important &ldquo;P&rdquo;: People.   A people strategy is at the center of today&rsquo;s dynamic and fluid social marketing mix. John Janitsch of Duct Tape Marketing has another take on the four Ps, and has turned them into four Cs for the social age: Content, Context, Connection and Community.</p>
<p>A people strategy is much broader, deeper and more profound than consumer targeting. It involves listening to and engaging with everyone who can touch or influence current and potential customers at all stages of brand interaction. Jeff Pulver is a savvy guy who has had his finger on the pulse of this dynamic for some time. &ldquo;The social media revolution is less about &#8220;we the people&#8221; and more about &#8220;me the people,&#8221; Pulver said.</p>
<p>Social media has changed the way people interact amongst themselves and with their media. People play multiple &#8212; sometimes simultaneous &#8212; roles as receivers, creators, critics, advocates, transformers and transmitters of messages. Brian Solis&rsquo; conversation prism helps to put this mash-up into perspective.</p>
</p>
<h2> This Is Why<br /></h2>
<p>A &ldquo;Me the People&rdquo; mindset changes the way companies strategize, organize, monetize and commercialize their business. This recent statement from Bob MacDonald, CEO of Procter &#038; Gamble, sums up just how far a &ldquo;me the people&rdquo; movement can go: &ldquo;What I would like to have is a one-on-one relationship with seven billion people in the world and be able to customize offerings for those seven billion people. Digital allows that relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seth Godin&#8217;s insight into how this is driving change in C-suites is brilliant &#8212; the role of the CMO has changed from Chief <i>Marketing</i> Officer to Chief <i>Movement</i> Officer.</p>
<p>The stage is set.  In 2010, social media has introduced the advertising business to its next big disruption. But this time the state of the advertising business is quite different. Advertising is struggling to recapture relevance. It is mired in murky fee-based compensation systems, dealing with loss of control and trying to keep up with the accelerating pace of media dispersion.</p>
<h2> A Much Needed Mindset Shift<br /></h2>
<p>For Madison Avenue to make it through this change and emerge stronger there has to be a mindset shift away from deficit-based, downside thinking to asset-based, upside thinking. Madison Avenue needs to embrace the power of letting go, reaffirm core values that maximize the potential of what is working and experiment with new models. Here are five suggestions for that &ldquo;up&rdquo; mindset shift:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lighten Up.</strong> Stop lamenting the end of advertising as we know it. Celebrate the emergence of advertising as the consumer wants it and as it was meant to be &#8212; the art of one-on-one persuasion.</li>
<li><strong>Listen Up</strong>. Take Chris Brogan&rsquo;s advice. Grow bigger ears and become an expert at listening to what people feel. Value response and engagement skills as much as creative abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Loosen Up</strong>. Get comfortable with giving up control to gain confidence and traction with clients and consumers. Client relationships ought to be rooted in trust, transparency and creative programs that are built on a strong positioning and responsibly deliver what is promised.</li>
<li><strong>Ladder It Up</strong>.  Embrace &ldquo;collabetition.&rdquo; Resist the urge to say &ldquo;we can do it all&rdquo; and openly collaborate with like-minded competitors to add value to an idea or program.</li>
<li><strong>Live It Up</strong>. Everyone at an agency has to immerse themselves in the &ldquo;social circles&rdquo; in which consumers live and move everyday. Observation and understanding have been trumped by participation and engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some other lessons we can keep in mind moving forward. Advertising is an art, made up of ideas that can move and persuade people.  Technology, digital tools and metrics are useful but they cannot come up with those ideas for you.</p>
<p>Energize creatives to go beyond just making ads. They should become masters of sustained transmedia storytelling.  Involve media people at all levels of development.</p>
<p>Lastly, invite consumer participation in the creative process through dialogue, inclusion and experimentation. Wisely directed user-generated content and crowdsourced ideas can be a huge asset.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I believe that the advertising business is ready to enter its next golden age. Bill Bernbach, an influential and inspiring &#8220;Mad Man&#8221; I had the privilege to work for, had these words of advice: &ldquo;An idea can turn to dust or magic depending upon the talent that rubs against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now is the time to be magicians.</p>

 </p>
<p>During the last mercurial cycle, I asked several super-successful types what killed businesses. If we can somehow work on eradicating a few simple mistakes, the next few years will rock. </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Stagnation. Evolve or die. Just sitting there will sure help your butt grow, but not much else. Change with the times only if you want to stay ahead of your competition. Imagine you&#039;re okay, and you are surely asleep.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Lack of planning. Find your niche, craft a plan, and then stick with it each day. It&#039;s easy for businesses to not stay focused on what they do best. If your plan isn&#039;t working, tweak the mother quickly.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Turning off loyal customers. Too many businesses focus on bringing in new and ignore their old. Since 20 percent of customers are responsible for 80 percent of business, it&#039;s a lot easier to keep loyal customers happy than to find new ones. I call that &#8220;horizontal growth.&#8221; If your clients think you treat them amazingly, they&#039;ll sell you to others better than you ever can. For sure.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Thinking you know it all. If you&#039;re not staying informed about the world, you&#039;ll be left behind. That means forcing yourself to go out and find out about topics you &#8220;could care less about.&#8221; The stuff you love&#8211;don&#039;t chase it, it&#039;ll come in through your pores.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Not keeping up with your customers&#039; interests. Follow trends in the media, pay attention to what businesses down the street are doing, and be a spotter of trends so that you don&#039;t become obsolete&#8211;or worse, stale. Ask customers what&#039;s working, what&#039;s not, and why. Do it without cynicism or thin-skinned defensiveness!</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Staying quiet. Get the word out about who you are and what you offer&#8211;and don&#039;t worry about giving away the &#8220;company secrets.&#8221; People should know what you&#039;re doing. Don&#039;t be self-important. I always hear &#8220;Someone will steal this.&#8221; So what? You were first.  Also, leverage aggressive marketing techniques, our old pal the Internet, and even freaking 411.com. Do stunts&#8211;but only if they match the mission of what you are proffering. And yeah, PR. There are actual influential big mouths who can make your product or service a big deal. That isn&#039;t a myth, Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong>. Having a tepid message. Think about how you want customers to feel and what you want them to do. Then craft memorable messages that are bent on surprising them and that make them go &#8220;woo, woo!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Being inconsistent. If you act like an ass in public, it&#039;s probably best to give the paying customers what they seem to want. If you&#039;re a sweetheart, show that side of you all the time. Businesses are about people&#8211;but only the ones who pay to see the fake you. Don&#039;t try to be someone new. It&#039;s fake.</p>
<p><strong>9. </strong>Neglecting the art of &#8220;What The Fuck!&#8221; Sometimes you have to throw away old wisdom. Go with your gut. My friend tells me The Dalai Lama said that at Radio City last month!</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Worrying about what people think. That won&#039;t get you anywhere. No one is paying attention to things like you are <em>absolutely positive</em> they are as you fall asleep at night.  But if folks are mocking you&#8211;good.  The biggest successes are those who enjoy being laughed at all the time.  I know I do.</p>
