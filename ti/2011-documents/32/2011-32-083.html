	The votes are in from <a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/oscar-fever/" target="_blank">our Oscar crowdsourcing experiment</a>, and the crowd successfully picked the winners of 14 of the academy awards. For reference, <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D/20110210/OSCARS/110219999" target="_blank">Roger Ebert got 15 predictions correct</a> so we'd have to conclude that the crowd performed reasonably well at predicting the winners of this glorified popularity contest.</p> <div><a rel="attachment wp-att-2191" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/03/oscar-fever-the-sequel/actual_results/"></a>

	Predicted and Actual Winners of the 2011 Academy Awards</p></div> 

	<span></span>
 One fascinating thing about aggregating responses is that the crowd as a whole will often outperform the average worker. In this case, among the 500 people we polled, the majority of respondents picked fewer than 10 awards correctly (mean of 9.6 and median of 9). And yet, by aggregating all the responses, such that the nominee with the most "votes" is predicted to win, the crowd as a whole correctly picked 14 awards. While the "wisdom of crowds" doesn't come as much of a surprise, it's always reassuring to see it confirmed in new applications.</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-2199" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/03/oscar-fever-the-sequel/correct_histogram1/"></a></p> 

	As we noted in<a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/oscar-fever/"> our earlier post</a>, though, the more interesting question was whether workers who indicated higher confidence in their responses would outperform workers with lower confidence. Looking at the results, however, we saw no significant correlation between a worker's predicted accuracy and  actual performance.</p> <div><a rel="attachment wp-att-2222" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/03/oscar-fever-the-sequel/scatts/"></a>

	"Squint all you want, but there&#39;s no pattern"</p></div> 

	While it's certainly possible that we didn't offer enough of an incentive for workers to estimate their own accuracy, the more likely explanation is that predicting the winners of the Oscars is not something that a person can do with any degree of certainty. Confident or not, the people we polled did not see the "Inside Job" coming.</p> 

	As a final exercise, we ran a regression on every explanatory variable we could find, including what state workers came from, what day they made their predictions, whether they made their predictions during the day or at night, how long they spent making their predictions and even their historical accuracy on other CrowdFlower tasks. The only variable with any significance turned out to be how long they spent on making their predictions, and while it was significant (at p=0.001), no model we could come up with explained more than 5 percent of the total variation in accuracy.</p> 

	While the wisdom of crowds seems to extend to picking Oscar winners, the more interesting experiment of having workers self-select as trustworthy is ongoing. In the future, it would be worthwhile to repeat this experiment with questions that can be answered objectively and without uncertainty (solving algebra problems seems like a good candidate), to see if any correlation emerges between predicted and actual accuracy.</p> </div></div><li class="textbox1"><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/doloreslabs/~3/ngb007h1o_A/"  target="_blank" ><span class="arrowdown"></span></a><a class="noeffect" title="click to view here" onclick="switchMenu('menu3')"><span class="name">Oscar Fever</span></a></li><div id=menu3 class="aholder"  style=" display:none; "><div class="article">

	With the most glamorous award ceremony of the year just around the corner, we asked 500 people from across the United States to help predict who the big winners are going to be. Below are their predictions, sorted in descending order of agreement.</p> <div><a rel="attachment wp-att-2185" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/oscar-fever/predictions/"></a>

	"I&#39;d like to thank all the little people..."</p></div> 

	Based on these early results, Pixar looks like a lock for yet another Best Animated Picture award and Natalie Portman had better start polishing her acceptance speech.</p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	Anyone can make anonymous predictions, so we made things interesting by rewarding workers for answering correctly. We structured the job such that everyone receives 5 cents for completing the survey, plus an additional 2 cents for each correct answer.</p> 

	To spice things up even more, we asked workers to guess how many predictions they would answer correctly (their "Magic Number," with a minimum of 5), with the stipulation that we will pay bonuses only to those workers who answer at least their Magic Number of predictions correctly.</p> 

	As you can see below, while quite a few workers played it safe by selecting the minimum number of correct responses ("5&#8243;), the most frequent choice was a Magic Number of 10. Also, more than a few brave souls thought they would get _every_ prediction correct.</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-2144" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/oscar-fever/magic_numbers/"></a></p> 

	But the big question, apart from whether Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan) can edge out David Fincher (The Social Network) for Best Director, is whether any correlation exists between worker confidence and actual performance. When workers have a cash incentive to estimate their own accuracy correctly, do the self-labeled "experts" perform any better than the "novices" at predicting Oscar winners?</p> 

	Make some popcorn, grab your Kleenex and stay tuned. After they've rolled up the red carpet, we'll come back and see who did a better job of predicting the winners.</p> </div></div><li class="textbox1"><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/doloreslabs/~3/C4C-7tkix00/"  target="_blank" ><span class="arrowdown"></span></a><a class="noeffect" title="click to view here" onclick="switchMenu('menu4')"><span class="name">Crowdsourcing Meetup (New Office edition)</span></a></li><div id=menu4 class="aholder"  style=" display:none; "><div class="article"><div><a rel="attachment wp-att-1357" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/09/crowdsourcing-work-meetup-south-bay-edition/crowd/"></a>

	I'm sitting here with my co-founder watching the Super Bowl. We were watching the Chrysler commercial with Eminem and arguing about whether people would like it.</p> 

	A quick Twitter search showed that people are talking about it and have strong opinions.</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-2075" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/analyzing-the-eminem-superbowl-commercial/screen-shot-2011-02-06-at-6-59-35-pm/"></a></p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	But how do the people on Twitter feel?</p> 

	I pulled a few hundred posts from Twitter's RSS feed, and I set up a quick job on CrowdFlower:</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-2074" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/analyzing-the-eminem-superbowl-commercial/screen-shot-2011-02-06-at-6-57-13-pm/"></a></p> 

	I tagged a few results with my desired answers to ensure the quality control would be reliable, and a few minutes later I have my answer!</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-2080" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/analyzing-the-eminem-superbowl-commercial/screen-shot-2011-02-06-at-6-53-04-pm/"></a></p> 

	Looks like people liked the ad -- at least on Twitter.  I don't want to overstate the results: the tweets weren't sampled in a truly random way (as they were pulled in discrete blocks of time), and if I had more time I would have set up a more defined task with specific examples.</p> 

	But, wow, it's amazing that we live in a world where I can run an analysis like that in a few minutes with over 50 people hand-labeling results.</p> </div></div><li class="textbox1"><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/doloreslabs/~3/FXBRd86XrMA/"  target="_blank" ><span class="arrowdown"></span></a><a class="noeffect" title="click to view here" onclick="switchMenu('menu6')"><span class="name">And the crowd goes wild (revisited)</span></a></li><div id=menu6 class="aholder"  style=" display:none; "><div class="article">

	A few months ago, we <a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/10/and-the-crowd-goes-wild/">created a crowdsourced ranking of NFL players</a> according to their fantasy value. For those just tuning in, we took the Top 75 players in ESPN's preseason preview as the experimental sample, paired them against each other, then had workers through the CrowdFlower platform select the better of the two.</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-1949" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/and-the-crowd-goes-wild-revisited/fastasy_ui/"></a> Now that the regular season has finished, let's see who did a better job of predicting the final ranking of this sample. Of the 75 players in the sample, only 28 finished in the Top 50. In other words, ESPN's team of experts failed to predict nearly half of the most valuable players in 2010.</p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-2000" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/and-the-crowd-goes-wild-revisited/final_ranks/"></a></p> 

	We brushed off this halting start by Team ESPN and looked at those players in the preseason sample who did finish in the Top 50. Did Team ESPN or Team CrowdFlower do a better job of ranking them? To find out, we looked at which of the two ranking systems contained more of the top players at a number of intervals.</p> 

	For example, of the seven most valuable players, five were in the preseason sample. Team CrowdFlower correctly picked four of the five, which we'll call a Precision Score at 7 of 0.8 (that is 4 out of 5 players, or 80 percent). Team ESPN, on the other hand, picked only two of the five players to finish in the Top 7, corresponding with a Precision Score at 7 of 0.4.</p> 

	 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-1998" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2011/02/and-the-crowd-goes-wild-revisited/precisionatk1/"></a></p> 

	As you can see in the graph above, crowdsourced workers were at least as good as ESPN's experts. For the Top 5 Rated players, Team CrowdFlower predicted all three of the players in the preseason sample, while Team ESPN picked zero. For the Top 20 Rated players, Team CrowdFlower predicted 9 of the 13 players in the preseason sample (Precision Score at 20 of 0.69) while Team ESPN predicted only 6 of the 13 players (Precision Score at 20 of 0.46).</p> 

	Across the board, crowdsourced workers never performed worse than a professional team of experts at predicting the value of Fantasy Football players. Approximately 80 percent of the time, crowdsourced workers were better. Most interesting, the biggest difference between crowdsourced workers and experts was for the most valuable players.</p> </div></div><li class="textbox1"><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/doloreslabs/~3/ZXlTGOfMjRU/"  target="_blank" ><span class="arrowdown"></span></a><a class="noeffect" title="click to view here" onclick="switchMenu('menu7')"><span class="name">Crowdsourcing the Haiti relief: one year later</span></a></li><div id=menu7 class="aholder"  style=" display:none; "><div class="article">

	It's hard to look back on the Haitian earthquake without being overwhelmed by the destruction and tremendous loss of human life. The standing wreckage in Port-au-Prince marks just how much recovery work still remains.</p> 

	</p> 

	At the same time, we continue to be inspired by the collaboration in response to the tragedy. It demonstrates how a rapidly deployed workforce of far-flung volunteers changes the nature of emergency relief efforts.</p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	After the earthquake, aid workers flooded the capital, but lacked information about who needed help, where they were, and what type of help they needed. <a href="http://medic.frontlinesms.com/">FrontLineSMS:Medic</a> and the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">U.S. Department of State</a> worked with Haitian telecom companies to set up an SMS short code, 4636, allowing Haitians to submit real-time reports. This text message method used less bandwidth than the two-way audio, which caused system outages on the country’s cell networks. The text messages that came in were in Kréyol and the aid agencies were unable to translate the messages fast enough.</p> 

	CrowdFlower provided the infrastructure to route SMS texts to thousands of Haitians (both in-country and around the world), found in part by <a href="http://www.samasource.org/">Samasource</a>. These Haitians translated texts from Port-au-Prince in real time and categorized the victims’ issues, allowing the agencies to direct specialists to the people who needed specific services: e.g., getting potable water to thirsty people, routing doctors to injured people. Agencies could also see hotspots, maps were created through <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahadi</a> -- an open-source platform that allows people or organizations to collect and visualize information.</p> 

	This crowdsourced innovation enabled relief teams to react with exactness and agility that would have been unthinkable even 10 years ago. </p> 

	<a href="http://www.mission4636.org/">Mission 4636</a> (as this collaboration has come to be known) processed 100,000 SMS messages in total, processing 5,000 SMS messages in one hour at peak volume. The average response time to translate, map/geocode and categorize a message did not exceed 2 minutes. The maps generated by Ushahidi were used by numerous organizations, including the Red Cross, Plan International, charity:water, U.S. State Department, AIDG, USAID, FEMA, and the World Food Program.</p> 

	And two major disasters in the subsequent months would demonstrate the power of human collaboration on a massive scale. </p> 

	After an oil spill struck the Gulf of Mexico, CrisisCommons created <a href="http://oilreporter.org/tools">Oil Reporter</a>, an app that gives anyone with an iPhone or an Android a real-time way to document and geotag oil that needs to be cleaned up. And <a href="http://pakreport.org/">Pakreport</a> used the Ushahadi platform and translators through CrowdFlower to geolocate and translate SMS reports from the ground in response to the floods in Pakistan.</p> 

	Though we cannot predict when the next disaster will occur, we can shape how well we respond to it. The ongoing work of organizations like Ushahidi will be critical to these relief efforts.</p>

	</p> 

	Can the quality of crowdsourced work be linked to geography?</p> 

	In short, the answer is no. Here's why.</p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	Our team looked at whether including a workforce from a specific region helped or hurt the completion rate and quality of a recent website categorization project. Overall, the project showed a common trend, where the quality of work improved over time, regardless of geography. </p> 

	</p> 

	The figure above shows the overall volume of judgments (blue) plotted against trusted judgments (green). In addition to the large amount of untrusted work over the first two days, this graph shows spikes in volume that correspond with time of day. Two possible explanations for the change in quality are: </p> 

 	* Only good workers were able to continue working after the first few days. 
 	* A flood of bad work from specific geographies, related to the spikes in throughput at certain hours.
 

 

	“JUST A TASTE” WORKERS</p> 

	One of the ways that CrowdFlower maintains quality is by incorporating questions with known answers, and tracking worker performance on these units as a proxy for overall accuracy. If workers don’t maintain a minimum level of accuracy, they are prohibited from continuing work on any given task.</p> 

	In this job, it appears that many workers were unable to meet our quality standards. This was a somewhat subtle categorization job, characterizing the content of websites according to handful of criteria, so it’s not surprising that many workers had trouble. </p> 

	As a result, many workers did a relatively small amount of work, but they could not continue because they didn’t meet our quality standards. The figure below shows the number of workers completing a specified number of judgments. </p> 

	</p> 

	This graph demonstrates a known behavior in online tasks, where many workers attempt only a small amount of work before abandoning a given task. Our quality-control mechanism requires workers to demonstrate accuracy before it accepts their work.</p> 

	While it is interesting that our quality control identified certain high accuracy workers and allowed them to continue, this doesn’t answer the question of why there were such dramatic changes in throughput during the day. </p> 

	NON-US WORKERS</p> 

	Especially over the first two days, the relative amount of untrusted work was much greater between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m. (Pacific Time), which is when we see a preponderance of work coming from workers outside of the United States. Indeed, after filtering workers by IP address, we saw that 73 percent of all workers in this job came from India. On the other hand, the region's workers accounted for only 46 percent of trusted workers. </p> 

	</p> 

	However, while these workers account for a relatively small proportion of trusted workers, they did much better in terms of trusted work submitted.</p> 

	</p> 

	This workforce accounts for fully two-thirds of the total trusted work on this job. While that is somewhat less than their overall representation in the labor pool, this suggests that we can’t dismiss these workers as low-quality.</p> 

	PARETO ME THIS</p> 

	All of this raises a very interesting observation. As you may have seen elsewhere<sup>1</sup>, a relatively small minority of people often account for the vast majority of observed effects. This is common in crowdsourcing, just as it was in terms of land ownership in 19th century Italy.</p> 

	</p> 

	In this example, the top three percent of most prolific workers provided over 40 percent of trusted work. The top 20 percent of workers provided over 80 percent of trusted work. </p> 

	KEEP THE BUMS OUT</p> 

	Focusing on the top 20 percent of most prolific workers, we see that one-half came from India while another one-third came from the U.S. Other countries provided the remaining workers. While it is true that the vast majority of untrusted workers in this job, who collectively provided relatively few judgments, came from India, it is also true that the country's workers make up half of the most prolific workers and provided two-thirds of all trusted work. </p> 

	The solution to improving the efficiency of this job, then, is not the crude choice of excluding workers from certain geographies. Rather, we can discourage bad workers by increasing the burden of entry, so that only workers with an interest in completing more than a few judgments will bother with the job.</p>

	 Writing is easy. Just sit in front of a typewriter, open up a vein and bleed it out drop by drop.
 <span>- Red Smith</span></p></blockquote> <div></a>

	Underwood Five Typewriter</p></div> 

	When I was in college, a professor I respected said that one of the best ways to demystify writing is to write like people you admire. Specifically, to find passages that you love, and try to revise them in your own words. This exercise proved invaluable. It allowed me to walk in their literary footsteps, shedding light on why they chose -- or avoided -- certain words, punctuation, and syntax.</p> 

	With this in mind, I recently wondered whether you can crowdsource writing, specifically, revising.</p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	I posted a task through CrowdFlower that asked the crowd to rewrite four famous quotations, pithily, while preserving their meaning.</p> 

	</p> 

	In one evening, I was able to get 20 revisions of each quotation from people across the country. I won't summarize them all here, but I will pull a few highlights.</p> 

	ORIGINAL QUOTATION 1 (FROM _<A HREF="HTTP://WWW.BARTLEBY.COM/100/138.31.118.HTML">MACBETH</A>_, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE):</p> <blockquote>

	 To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,/ Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,/ To the last syllable of recorded time;/ And all our yesterdays have lighted fools/ The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!/ Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player/ That struts and frets his hour upon the stage/ And then is heard no more. It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury/ Signifying nothing.</p></blockquote> 

	REVISION 1:</p> <blockquote>

	 Time marches on, and everyone dies; life is meaningless.
 <span>- Hatboro, PA</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote>

	 Life creeps along and ends suddenly like the end of a bad play. The play is dramatic and had poor acting, and has no point or moral in the end.
 <span>-Salt Lake City, UT</span></p></blockquote> 

	ORIGINAL QUOTATION 2 (FROM "<A HREF="HTTP://WWW.BARTLEBY.COM/100/160.2.HTML">THE LEVIATHAN</A>," THOMAS HOBBES):</p> <blockquote>

	 No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.</p></blockquote> 

	REVISION 2:</p> <blockquote>

	 The life of a man on his own is barbaric and degrading.
 <span>- East Aurora, NY</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote>

	 No art, letters or society. Worst of all, living in fear of being alone, poor and short.
 <span>- Arlington, TX</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote>

	 Life is all but a mere scam.
 <span>-Overland Park, KS</span></p></blockquote> 

	ORIGINAL QUOTATION 3 ("<A HREF="HTTP://WWW.BARTLEBY.COM/124/PRES31.HTML">FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS</A>," ABRAHAM LINCOLN):</p> <blockquote>

	 We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</p></blockquote> 

	REVISION 3:</p> <blockquote>

	 We're fools for fighting each other. We should co-operate, and let our example bring everyone together.
 <span>- Plattsburgh, NY</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote>

	 We must be friends, we should now forget each other. Our memories will always stay through our rough times and good times.
 <span>- Tallahassee, FL</span></p></blockquote> 

	ORIGINAL QUOTATION 4 (FROM "<A HREF="HTTP://WWW.BARTLEBY.COM/165/1.HTML">CHICAGO</A>," CARL SANDBURG):</p> <blockquote>

	 "They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys."</p></blockquote> 

	REVISION 4:</p> <blockquote>

	 Your reputation follows you and it is a bad one, makeup and lust.
 <span>- Iola, WI</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote>

	 This city isn't a nice place, it's full of hookers.
 <span>- Milledgeville, GA</span></p></blockquote>

	What's your opinion? Can the revision process be crowdsourced?</p>

	As the NFL season loomed on the horizon back in August, there was a lot of fantasy football talk around the CrowdFlower office. Naturally, we decided to crowdsource a killer fantasy football team. </p> <div><a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/10/and-the-crowd-goes-wild/fantasyfootballtackle-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1602"></a>

	<span></span></p> 

	We asked CrowdFlower workers to help us build a ranked list of the Top 75 players to guide our fantasy football draft. We used pair-wise comparisons to determine rankings. Specifically, we presented workers with two players, asking them to pick which player they thought would be more valuable. </p> 

	We used the Top 75 players from ESPN’s 2010 Fantasy Football Draft Kit<sup>1</sup>, matching each player with his 74 counterparts, giving us a total of 2,775 player pairs. We also included each player’s position and team, as well as a link to more detailed statistics.</p> <div><a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/10/and-the-crowd-goes-wild/fantasyfootballtask/" rel="attachment wp-att-1563"></a>

	After the job finished, we ordered the players according to number of head-to-head victories.</p> <div><a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/10/and-the-crowd-goes-wild/player_rankings/" rel="attachment wp-att-1565"></a>

	Crowdsourced list of the Top 25 most valuable fantasy football players.</p></div>
 (Download the full results <a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/initial-ranking.xlsx">here</a>.)</p> 

	We found that workers choose the player on the left 53 percent of the time, even though each match-up appears twice, once with Player A on the left and again with Player A on the right. With 5,500 data points, this is significant bias toward the player on the left. However, the final ranking doesn’t change even after accounting for this bias.</p> 

	We settled on two likely explanations for the bias:</p> 

 	* The anchoring effect of putting something on the left (and as the first response option) may have caused more workers to select the first player. 
 	* Our <a href="http://crowdflower.com/docs/gold" "target="_blank"">Gold</a> was slightly biased toward the player on the left, which we have previously seen<sup>2</sup> to have an effect on the overall distribution of the answers.
 

 

	As a first comparison of our crowd of football fans with ESPN’s Fantasy Football brain trust, we plotted each player by the difference between his two rankings. </p> 

	<div><a href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/10/and-the-crowd-goes-wild/espn_vs_crowd/" rel="attachment wp-att-1561"></a>

	Players on the left were ranked higher by ESPN, while players on the right were ranked higher by AMT.</p></div> 

	Will Chad Ochocinco and Matt Ryan vindicate the crowd? Stay tuned to find out.</p>

	When you believe in something, it's easy to sell.</p> 

	The offer to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/23/dave-mcclure-dials-up-250k-for-twilio-startups/" "target="_blank"">fund companies</a> that work smarter is, well &#8230; smart. </p> 

	Dave McClure is smart and has an easy job.</p> 

	His new proposal funds companies that use other companies' time-saving, cost-cutting offerings. <a href="http://500startups.com/" target="_blank">500 Startups'</a> microfunds are geared at open-minded, smart people: trendsetters and early adopters who are looking for a more efficient way to get work done.</p> 

	</p> 

	He's kicked off the fund by showcasing <a href="http://www.twilio.com/" "target="_blank"">Twilio</a> and <a href="http://crowdflower.com/" "target="_blank"">CrowdFlower</a>. (Added bonus for businesses: Using companies like Twilio and CrowdFlower are good for your business because the products are elastic and on-demand.) </p> 

	<span></span></p> 

	Today, 500 Startups kicks off a <a href="http://500startups.com/crowdflowerfund" "target="_blank"">CrowdFlower Fund</a> that will help bring needed crowdsourcing technology to companies. $250,000 will be split across multiple companies who are investigating bringing crowdsourcing into their supply chain -- effectively keeping a human in the loop for quick, low-cognizance queries.</p> 

	500 Startups will invest $10,000 in up to 10 companies for a 1% stake. And it may select one or more of these companies for a $50,000 investment and an invitation to participate in the soon-to-be announced accelerator program at the 500 Startups space in Mountain View, CA.(Interested companies should apply online at <a href="http://500startups.com/crowdflowerfund" "target="_blank"">http://500startups.com/crowdflowerfund</a> beginning today. Investment decisions will be made on a rolling basis thereafter.)</p> 

	CrowdFlower helps companies with many types of tasks that humans do better and faster than machine algorithms by sourcing people for their processing power. A human being can quickly tell you if a photo contains a person or just a landscape, if a product is categorized correctly, or if your business listings are accurate. Say you want to make a new dictionary -- like startup <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" "target="_blank"">Wordnik</a>, a CrowdFlower user -- that accounts for the way a word "feels," in order to provide the appropriate connotation. A computer program cannot decipher the feelings behind most words, but a human can. Other startups that have benefited from CrowdFlower's real-time human input include: <a href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/" "target="_blank"">PeopleBrowsr</a> (sentiment analysis of social media content), <a href="http://www.skout.com/" "target="_blank"">Skout</a> (content moderation), <a href="http://www.bizo.com/home" "target="_blank"">Bizo</a> (tagging and organizational categorization of businesses).</p> 

	Crowdsourcing makes this type of indexing possible. People can add attributes to images, or fly through webpages to get the "right" answer to a question.</p> 

	Companies will be able to harness the fire hose of information that is coming from social media platforms. By crowdsourcing projects, people and companies will be able to create rich user experiences and build apps that are able to push data the likes of which we've never seen before. We are able to engage with a lot of data in an increasingly smarter way.</p>

	Marcel Proust</p></div> 

	A few months ago, I started a <a href="http://mechanicalproust.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"">blog</a> written by Mechanical Turk workers. Eight times a day, on the hour, a script posts a personal question on MTurk. The questions are randomly selected from a subset of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire">Proust Questionnaire</a>. Example questions include:</p> 

 	* What is your favorite food and drink?
 	* What is your idea of misery?
 	* Which natural talent would you most like to be gifted with?
 

 

	<span></span></p> 

	The first worker to submit his or her answer automatically has their response anonymously posted on the blog, which I call "Mechanical Proust." Workers are told that their responses will made public, but remain anonymous. I make no attempt to check responses before they are posted, nor do I check whether a worker has submitted in the past. (I enabled Google Ads to see if I could make the blog financially self-sustaining. No luck here so far.)</p> 

	<a rel="attachment wp-att-1154" href="http://blog.crowdflower.com/2010/09/mechanical-proust-an-automated-crowd-written-blog/wiseass/"></a></p> 

	<span>What have I learned? Most of the responses are unsurprising but they are occasionally poignant or insightful. People are proud of their children. They regret dropping out of school. They want to live in Paris. They fear dying and being alone. They like chicken dishes, etc. Lots of workers are funny (see screenshot at left). </span></p> 

	<span>
 </span></p> 

TECHNICAL NOTES:

 

	A Python script posts the questions (using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/">boto</a>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> schedules them. The questions are presented as external HITs, with the "submit" button launching another Python script that posts the text response to the blog, using Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/docs/1.0/developers_guide_python.html">API</a>. If you want the code or want help making something similar, let me know.</p> 

NEXT STEPS (TAKEN BY SOMEONE ELSE):

 

	I'd like to see someone make a new version of this blog where blog readers could submit questions, which would go into a queue, with newer questions going at the bottom. Each new question would have up/down Reddit-type buttons, which could move questions up and down the stack. Questions could then be posted on MTurk LIFO-style.</p> </div></div></ul>
