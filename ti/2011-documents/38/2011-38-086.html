If we were to give it a dictionary definition, outsourcing would be the process of an organization or individual transferring the ownership of a business process to a supplier (which in turn can be an organization or individual). Some would argue that this is a simple business relationship, but with outsourcing there’s a catch. The difference between a simple business relationship and outsourcing is the way the control over the business process is handled and transferred. In the first case, the buyer retains full control over the entire process and simply tells the supplier what to do, with details nailed down to the point. With outsourcing however, the buyer rarely instructs the supplier on HOW to do the work. Basically, the buyer will simply tell the supplier WHAT he needs and give him a set of general guidelines, but it’s left to the supplier’s creativity to get the job done. Of course, outsourcing is a double-edged sword for both buyers and suppliers. From the buyer’s perspective, the benefits of outsourcing are the reduced involvement in the project, which allows for more spare time focused in a different direction. You don’t have to keep a constant eye on the supplier’s work, simply because you’re more interested in the final outcome than on how they handle things. On the other hand, the end result might not be satisfactory, which creates a sort of deadlock situation. On one hand, the supplier might argue that that’s what you asked for and that you did not provide them with conclusive information. From the supplier’s point of view, outsourcing can be both a pain and a boon. On the bright side, you have almost full control over the project and you can choose your own ways to get it done. However, you risk not hitting the points that the buyer aims for, especially if his communication skills are not very high. Outsourcing is a bigger business branch, containing several smaller ones such as offshore outsourcing, crowdsourcing and freelancing. Offshore outsourcing is mainly a term used by US-based businesses, describing the outsourcing of projects in Europe or Asia. The projects are sent over to outsourcing companies in countries that are less developed, offering a cheaper work force at equal quality. The IT market for example is constantly being offshore outsourced in India, Romania or Ukraine as well as several other countries. Crowdsourcing is a clever business technique that relies on enthusiasts to do the job done. For example, electronic freelancers, photo enthusiasts, amateur writers are all examples of crowdsourcing. Their work is bought of very cheap and oftentimes free and then used in a business. Crowdsourcing is considered slightly unethical by some, since the buyer will profit from someone’s work without having to pay for it, however in most cases, the suppliers will be glad to see their work being used, their photos being published and their articles appearing on websites or in magazines. Besides these methods, there are several other ones related to outsourcing, including homecoming, open trust outsourcing, supply chain outsourcing, vertical integration and so forth.</div>

It is the way in which business operates, or can be operated. The advent of current BPO revolution has been driven by the availability of cost effective technology such as Internet broadband services, inexpensive data storage, continued business process specialization and online analytical processing tool. The paradigm shift is that, the technology has enabled global exchange of BPO services. Today, BPO industry had matured to the extent that the costs are normalizing and becoming attractive. Over the last three decades Business Process Outsourcing has been catering to number of services like retail, insurance, mortgage, banking, finance, health care, telecommunications, travel, technology, hospitality and many more. Today, many offshore firms are consolidating and standardizing their operations by outsourcing their business process to third parties. There are many BPO service providers in India that offer cost effective and focused management expertise. In the present scenario many UK and US based firms are looking at countries like India, Philippines, China and other South Asian territories to outsource their services. According to a research conducted NelsonHall- a BPO analyst firm</p>
<p>80% of the firm claimed that, outsourcing has increased their competitiveness.</p>
<p>87% of the companies said that, outsourcing had improved their internal processes.</p>
<p>While 77% of the companies said that, they could see a significant drop in their operational cost through outsourcing.</p>
<p>The offshore BPO services are expected to grow at a significant rate per year within the Asia-Pacific market. The growth rate will be about $14 billion by the year 2010. The BPO business in India will be booming despite the current economic recession. The economy will stabilize and there five fold growth of the BPO industry within the next five years. According to a research, ‘Road map 2012 &#8211; capitalizing on the expanding BPO landscape’, conducted by Nasscom and Everest Group, the revenue of the Indian BPO industry will touch $50 billion and will add about 2.5% of the gross domestic product by the year 2012. Presently BPO sector employs about 8 lakh people and the annual revenue is about $11 billion. Over the next 5 years the BPO industry will employ nearly 2 million people. Once again, one reason why BPO has grown over the 10 years is the availability of high end technology and infrastructure. Without the availability of Internet and broadband, this could not have been possible. The development in technology has broken down the barriers of global communication. Considering the progress made in the outsourcing industry over the last ten years is standardizing and automation of business processes, the next five years promise similar advances. Typically, the multinational companies define market trends and the acceptance of new product and services. Keeping all these in mind, the BPO industry could take a new shape over the next five years.</p></div>
