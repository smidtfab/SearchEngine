    Passwords and Account Use.</b> You
    are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your
    password. You may not disclose your password to any third party (other
    than third parties authorized by you to use your account) and are solely
    responsible for any use of or action taken under your password on the

  <p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Amazon Mechanical Turk's Role.</b>
    Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a venue for third-party Requesters and
    third-party Providers to enter into and complete transactions. Amazon Mechanical
    Turk and its Affiliates are not involved in the transactions between Requesters
    and Providers. As a result, we have no control over the quality, safety
    or legality of the Services, the ability of Providers to provide the Services
    to Requesters' satisfaction, or the ability of Requesters to pay for Services.
    We are not responsible for the actions of any Requester or
    Provider. We do not conduct any screening or other verification with
    respect to Requesters or Providers, nor do we provide any
    recommendations. As a Requester or a Provider, you use the Site at your
    own risk.</p>
  <p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Your Use of the Site.</b></p>
  <p><b>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Requesters in General.</b> Upon
    completion of Services to Requesters' reasonable satisfaction, Requesters must
    pay Providers for their Services. As a Requester, you agree that upon
    your approval of the Services performed by a Provider, payment will be remitted to the Provider
    automatically (as described in Section 4 below). After you have approved the applicable Services, you are
    not entitled to any refund of your payment for such Services. If a Requester is
    not reasonably satisfied with the Services, the Requester may reject the
    Services. As a Requester, you will be charged a fee for your use of Amazon Mechanical
    Turk in connection with each request for Services. Please review the
    applicable Amazon Mechanical Turk Fees contained in the Policies for all
    applicable fees associated with your use of the Site pursuant to this
    Agreement. All fees are in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise.
    The Amazon Mechanical Turk Fees may vary in the future. You agree to pay
    the amounts set forth in the Amazon Mechanical Turk Fees from time to time on
    the terms set forth herein and therein, and to check the fees and terms each
    time you use the Site. You acknowledge that, while Providers are agreeing
    to perform Services for you as independent contractors and not employees,
    repeated and frequent performance of Services by the same Provider on your
    behalf could result in reclassification of that employment status. If you
    have any questions about your obligations to comply with local laws and
    regulations pursuant to Section 6, you should seek independent legal advice.
    To the extent you receive any contact or personal information
    regarding any Provider who has performed Services for you, such information may
    only be used as necessary for you to comply with applicable laws and for no
    other purpose whatsoever. Further, you agree that you will only accept work
    product from Providers that has been submitted through the Site.</p>
  <p><b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Providers in General.</b> You may only register once with Mechanical Turk as a Provider. Providers
    may perform Services for any Requester in accordance with the specifications
    submitted by the Requester. However, if the Services do not meet the Requester's
    reasonable satisfaction, the Requester may reject the Services and repost the

    Information and Feedback.</b> You
    must supply accurate and complete information for all Services in accordance
    with our data requirements, as may be designated by us from time to time,
    including in the Policies. You recognize and agree that Amazon Mechanical
    Turk will implement mechanisms allowing us and others to track your requests
    for, or your performance of, Services and rate your performance as a Requester
    or Provider, and Amazon Mechanical Turk reserves the right to collect feedback
    regarding your performance and to post such feedback on the Site. You may
    not take any actions that may undermine the integrity of the feedback system.
    You agree that submission of any information, feedback, content, data or
    other materials (collectively, "<b>Materials</b>") is at your own risk, and
    that none of Amazon Mechanical Turk, its Affiliates, Requesters or Providers
    has any obligations (including without limitation obligations of

  <p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Payment Service.</b> Amazon Mechanical Turk or its Affiliates
    will process all payments made by Requesters to Providers (the "<b>Payment Service</b>").
    Requester payments made through the Payment Service are received by Amazon Mechanical
    Turk or its Affiliates on behalf of Providers, and may be disbursed only in
    accordance with the terms outlined below.</p>
  <p><b>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Prepaid HITs.</b> Each Requester must prepay for work they intend on acquiring through the
    Services by purchasing Mechanical Turk Prepaid HITs ("<b>Prepaid HITs</b>") from Amazon Payments, Inc.
    Prepaid HITs are subject to the <a href="/mturk/prepaidterms">Mechanical Turk Prepaid HITs Terms and Conditions</a>.
    Prepaid HITs are maintained in a single Prepaid HIT account for you solely for use of the Services.
    The amount of Prepaid HITs purchased must be at least equal to the total amount that will be owed to
    Providers upon completion and acceptance of the Services and any amounts payable to Amazon
    Mechanical Turk in connection with Requester's use of the Site. If the Prepaid HITs are purchased with
    proceeds from a bank account, the Prepaid HITs may not be available for use for up to four (4) days
    before such funds are available for disbursement to a Provider's Payment Account (defined below).
    After Requester's acceptance of the Services, the Payment Service will debit the amount owed to each
    Provider from the Requester's Payment Account, and credit each Provider's Payment Account that amount.</p>
  <p><b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Disbursement of Funds to Providers.</b> When Providers register with the Site, a payment account
    ("<b>Payment Account</b>") will automatically be established in conjunction with their registration.
    Providers may disburse funds from their Payment Account by the
    following methods, at their option: (i) to an ACH-Enabled Bank
    Account in U.S. dollars; (ii) or by converting such funds to a credit that
    is held for the benefit of Provider in an <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/3122091/pop-up/ref=g_gc-dp_fp"
target=AmazonHelp
title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/3122091/pop-up/ref=g_gc-dp_fp">Amazon.com
    gift certificate account</a>. For select countries, Amazon Mechanical Turk may enable Providers to
    request disbursements through physical checks in U.S. or local currency.
    Check disbursements may be subject to additional fees, registration and
    documentary requirements. See our <a
href="/mturk/help?helpPage=worker#how_paid">FAQs</a> for more
    information. Funds will only be disbursed
    in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including without
    limitation the United States Patriot Act and the regulations of the Office of
    Foreign Assets Control. Providers may not share a bank account. We reserve the
    right to cancel your Payment Account for any reason.</p>
  <p><b>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Authorizations for ACH-Enabled Bank Account.</b> If you are a Provider, you hereby
    authorize Amazon Mechanical Turk and its
    Affiliates, and any third party service providers or agents acting on their
    behalf, to debit or credit your ACH-Enabled Bank Account (including by creating
    a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer) and/or your Payment Account, as
    applicable, (i) to transfer, disburse or process other payment
    transactions associated with the Services; and (ii) to settle payment for any fees that may be charged under
    this Agreement. In the event there is an error in the processing of any
    transaction described above, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit
    entries to your ACH-Enabled Bank Account or your Payment Account, as
    applicable, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in
    accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and to make any inquiries we
    consider necessary to validate the error, which may include ordering a credit
    report, performing credit checks, or verifying the information you provide against
    third party databases. If we are unable to debit any ACH-Enabled Bank
    Account you select for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus
    any applicable fees, to any other ACH-Enabled Bank Account you have on file
    with us (or, in the case of any fees that are owed under this Agreement, to
    deduct such amounts from the funds in your Payment Account). Your
    authorizations will remain in full force and effect until we receive written
    notification from you of any termination. Any termination will become
    effective as soon as we have had a reasonable amount of time to act on it, but
    in any event not later than thirty (30) days after written notice of
    termination is received by us in accordance with Section 12(e).</p>
  <p><b>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Restrictions and Limitations.</b> We
    reserve the right to terminate or suspend any Payment Account, or to delay the
    availability of any Prepaid HITs, transfer or disbursement of any amounts, in each case for any reason
    in our sole discretion, including, without limitation, if we believe that a
    Requester or Provider is in violation of this Agreement. As a security measure,
    we reserve the right to restrict the transfer to Providers of any amounts held
    in a Requester's Prepaid HIT account for up to three (3) Business Days (as defined
    below) following any purchase. Other than a credit to a Provider's Payment
    Account for Services rendered by such Provider, amounts held in Payment
    Accounts cannot be transferred to other Requesters or Providers. If Amazon Mechanical Turk terminates 
    this Agreement because you have violated the Policies then (i) any Services that have been completed 
    by Providers but not yet accepted by you will be deemed accepted and the applicable payments will be 
    remitted to the Providers and deducted from your Prepaid HITS balance and (ii) your remaining Prepaid 
    HITS balance (if any) will become the property of Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>
  <p><b>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Our Liability.</b> We (and our Affiliates) act only in
    the capacity of a payment processor in facilitating the transactions between
    Requesters and Providers, and are not otherwise involved in the actual
    transactions. We will only be responsible for initiating purchases of Prepaid HITs and the
    transfers or disbursements at the direction of Requesters and Providers.  We
    will be entitled to rely on the instructions of Requesters and Providers without any further inquiry or
    liability whatsoever. We will not be liable if we are not able to complete a transaction
    for any reason, including, but not limited to,</p>

    <li>If
      any system or equipment was not working properly and you knew or had been
      advised about the breakdown before you initiated the transaction;</li>
    <li>If
      you do not have enough available funds in your Prepaid HIT account or
      in your Payment Account to complete the applicable transaction, or if the
      transfer would cause you to exceed any applicable transfer limit with respect
      to your ACH-Enabled Bank Account;</li>
    <li>If
      circumstances beyond our control (such as, but not limited to, power
      outages, fire, flood, mechanical or systems failure) prevent the proper

      transfer requested is unauthorized; or</li>

      information.</li>
  </ul>

    Interest will not be paid on Prepaid HITs or any amounts held in Payment Accounts. If
    no transfer, disbursement or other payment transaction occurs with
    respect to your Payment Account for at least two (2) years and six (6) months,
    consecutively, the balance in your Payment Account will be automatically
    converted into an Amazon.com gift certificate and sent electronically to your
    then-current e-mail address associated with your Payment Account.</p>
