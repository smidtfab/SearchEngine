					<p>In our <a href="http://www.orbitalrpm.com/2010/review-fierce-cio-on-collaboration-tools/">last posting</a>, we highlighted CIO Tony Young&#8217;s thoughts on the future of email, which couldn&#8217;t have been more timely given the recent announcement of Facebook&#8217;s new messaging system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new system, as has been reported, is ultimately not a new concept but a convergence of three widely used services (email, IM and text messaging).   Early murmurs of &#8220;email killer&#8221; are running wild on the blogosphere.  Down the road this rumor may prove itself true, but at first glance this appears to be more of practice in collaboration than competition.  And in our humble observations of the evolution of the &#8220;Web 2.0,&#8221;  the theme of collaboration seems to be a common thread in all recipes for success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted, there have been some flashes of pure stand-alone brilliance, but ultimately it seems the widespread acceptance and utilization of a service goes hand in hand with the users&#8217; ability not only to contribute to a platform, but to &#8220;mashup&#8221; these platforms. Whether that collaboration is manifested through Open Source Software (such as OpenOffice from Sun Microsystems), Apple&#8217;s iOS Developer Program or the Facebook Connect API, the core element of each of their successes is in the practice of sharing knowledge and opening up tools, rather then sequestering them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, anecdotes for business innovation summon stories about &#8220;the mini-van&#8221; or &#8220;velcro,&#8221; or other similar moments of inspired genius.  In Silicon Valley it seems this traditional thinking around innovation has evolved to not only think of the consumer as a receiver of the product, but more importantly as a creator of the product.  In short, crowdsourcing is the new&nbsp;king.</p>
<p>And in this new thinking it appears to us the real question for businesses has effectively evolved from &#8220;what is our next great idea&#8221; to &#8220;how can we create a culture of sharing&nbsp;ideas.&#8221;</p>

Magazine on selecting collaboration tools</a>, though, I thought it was&nbsp;time&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://orbitalrpm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/cop-iceberg.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-300 alignright" title="cop-iceberg" src="http://orbitalrpm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/cop-iceberg-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183"&nbsp;/></a></p>
<p><a&nbsp;href="http://orbitalrpm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/cop-iceberg.png"></a></p>
<p>For many of the organizations that I speak/work with regarding knowledge networks/communities of practice they have [or are planning on implementing] a collaboration software package with many slick bells and whistles but without a clear path and strategy for getting up and running &#8211; this often results in an empty knowledge landscape with little showing except for some bells and whistles strewn&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Even in the CIO world it&#8217;s popular to <a href="http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/IT-Management/Finding-the-Essence-of-Innovation-458448/">say that collaboration and innovation isn&#8217;t about the software </a>but what do you do in addition to buying&nbsp;software? </p>
<h2>The Iceberg in&nbsp;IT</h2>
<p>The delimna I frequently witness is what I call the &#8216;Iceberg in IT&#8217; conundrum.  Someone decided that people needed to collaborate more and told IT to implement a package that enables collaboration.  While a good software package is certainly a required step, I prefer to put it near last instead of&nbsp;first. </p>
<p>Using the admittedly cliche and ubiquitous iceberg metaphor above, social software is simply the visible thing that enables collaboration to happen.  When IT is told to purchase it when there is no strategy to generate adoption, it will feel cold and barren [sorry - couldn't help it].  In order to truly affect how this can help people do their jobs there is a large amount of work that needs to done behind the scenes&#8230;hence the 7Cs of&nbsp;success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capturing:</strong>  the notion of collaboration is foreign in many organizations so people often need to be shown what potential is there if they were to collaborate.  We always visit different geographic locations and capture [via video, audio, memory stick, etc.] what people are working on so that we can determine common topics and have some seed material to begin populating the software&nbsp;system.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting:</strong>  even software that&#8217;s designed to connect people will do little in that regard if left on its own.  People [especially when at the early phases] need some help connecting with one another &#8211; simple things like setting up bridge calls and facilitating conversations serve to build trust and awareness and provide nuggets of content that can be housed in the&nbsp;platform.</li>
<li><strong>Combining:</strong> in a dispersed organization you&#8217;re bound to find bits and pieces of similar work living in a great many places.  Helping the users combine that information using the wiki feature of a platform, for example, will show users the efficiency in working together while training them on what in the world a &#8216;wiki&#8217;&nbsp;is.</li>
<li><strong>Contextualizing:</strong> the most effective collaboration initiatives will integrate members from an organization&#8217;s suppliers and customers and related academic institutions.  Translating that into compelling content that will make sense to your users will be critical in getting them to absorb and leverage&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><strong>Confirming:</strong>  similar to above, if you&#8217;re getting knowledge from various sources, care must be taken to ensure that what&#8217;s being provided is accurate information so that it can be acted&nbsp;upon.</li>
<li><strong>Circulating:</strong>  what good is the best information if no one knows about it?  The role of a community/network coordinator is essential in circulating news about what&#8217;s new, recent questions,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li><strong>Communicating:</strong> having someone dedicated to getting the word out about the success stories in your knowledge network will go a long way in generating interest, excitement and ,of course, additional funds that will be necessary to continue&nbsp;operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having an effective Web 2.0 collaboration platform at the center of this activity certainly will make it much easier to coordinate but the software alone [today's versions anyhow] will never replace the behind-the-scenes efforts required to start and sustain collaboration and&nbsp;innovation.</p>

<p>Notice the focus on the design of the physical space that they&#8217;re proposing and how that will help foster the necessary community that will be required for collaboration, learning and&nbsp;innovation.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m clearly a little biased in my support for this message &#8211; but that bias first came from all of the other sources that turned me on to this&nbsp;trend.</p>
<p>Using the ideas in the article, what can your organization do to prepare for the knowledge economy?  How can your workspace be configured to best support the way work happens?  How can you integrate the collaboration of your customers, suppliers and employees into the learning and innovation that will drive your organization&nbsp;forward?</p>

<p>This philosophy of &#8216;crowdsourcing&#8217; will be critical as we get further into the knowledge economy.  I encourage organizations to assess who they count on for success and then develop strategies to incorporate all of those groups into their learning/innovation pipeline.  [Note: a <a href="http://valuenetworks.com/">value network analysis</a> is a great tool to help visualize&nbsp;this.]</p>

					<p><img class="size-full wp-image-227 alignright" title="big-question" src="http://www.orbitalrpm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/big-question.gif" alt="big-question" width="180" height="133"&nbsp;/></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t participated for quite some time but this month&#8217;s <a href="http://learningcircuits.blogspot.com/2009/03/workplace-learning-in-10-years.html">Big Question on the Learning Circuits blog</a> was too&nbsp;intriguing&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you peer inside an organization in 10 years time and you look at how workplace learning is being supported by that organization, what will you&nbsp;see?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Knowledge&nbsp;Economy</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll preface the rest of the post by saying that I feel we&#8217;re currently well into a knowledge economy and that in ten years this transition will be even more apparent so my response will hinge upon that being true.  I view a knowledge economy as one being populated by workers creating and relying upon quick access to, and acquisition of, information that they need &#8211; organizations can range from construction to IT&#8230;as long as they depend on the acquisition of relevant info/knowledge in order to perform and improve they are staffed with knowledge workers in my opinion.  I do feel that the knowledge economy will bring with it different learning and development needs for the knowledge&nbsp;workforce.</p>
<p><strong>The Truthful&nbsp;Answer</strong></p>
<p>Quite frankly, I think the honest answer to the Big Question listed above is&#8230;not too much different from what we see&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Just like other societal transformations, I think our move into the knowledge economy will take a long time to cement itself into the philosophies and methodologies of organizations &#8211; this includes learning departments.  There are so many factors ranging from mental models of those that have been in the industry for a long time to infrastructures and contracts that are entrenched and cannot be uprooted quickly that will prevent a speedy transition to fully supporting the needs of the workforce in a&nbsp;decade.</p>
<p>I recently <a href="http://orbitalrpm.com/2009/2009-clo-intelligence-report-no-seat-at-the-table-with-this-data/">wrote about the 2008 Chief Learning Officer [CLO] Magazine report</a> on trends in the industry and the Executive Summary of this report shows no signs of much movement in the field.Â  Do I think this will change <em>substantially</em> over the business landscape in ten years?  No.  I certainly feel that there will be pockets of progressive organizations that will make some great shifts [as indeed there are already several examples of this today] but for the overall learning industry to fundamentally change how it sees the world of L&amp;D I think will take much&nbsp;longer.</p>
<p><strong>The Wishful&nbsp;Answer</strong></p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m being cynical and that the above proves not to be true because I feel that the next 10 years presents an enormous opportunity for L&amp;D to ramp up it&#8217;s organizational credibility to a place where we&#8217;re not yearning for a seat at the proverbial table&#8230;it&#8217;ll just be there&nbsp;waiting.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d love to see of L&amp;D departments in 10 years is one that oversees knowledge in the organization.  Departments that acknowledge that the vast majority of learning and development takes place outside of the classroom or computer [although some is better delivered in those places as well] and implement methods that reflect this&nbsp;ratio.</p>
<p>To me this looks like departments that ensures communities of practice and knowledge networks are thriving, active and supported by the right IT tools.  Ones that takes the role of redesigning the workspace [wherever it may be] of employees so that knowledge flows freely, ones that assesses the entire value network of an organization so that learning strategies can be extended to members whose performance affects that of the organization, ones that effectively integrate new-hires into their new network and provides the content they need when needed, ones that develops leaders to lead in a collaborative web and ones that promotes innovation throughput by running off of the energy created by the aforementioned&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;End</strong></p>
<p>As I said above, I think that L&amp;D Departments have a golden opportunity at the moment &#8211; to make this transition and show their organizations the value they can add by truly supporting the business workforce.  If this transition isn&#8217;t made I&#8217;m afraid other disciplines such as knowledge management may rush to fill the gap left by L&amp;D.  I really see these fields merging as I think the lines between them will begin to blur &#8211; so after all this rambling, maybe that&#8217;s what things will look like in 10&nbsp;years&#8230;</p>

<p>CLO [Chief Learning Officer] Magazine released their <a href="http://www.clomedia.com/business-intelligence-report/">2009 Business Intelligence Industry Report</a> today.  In full disclosure I have not read the detailed report [which is being sold for $495] &#8211; I just read the free Executive Summary but from the pieces in there I received a good enough overview to be&nbsp;disappointed.</p>
<p>A common lament in the L&amp;D world is how to get a &#8216;seat at the table&#8217; &#8211; in other words how can the L&amp;D function be seen as being strategic enough to warrant participation in the C-level strategy interactions that determine the direction and operation of the organization.  Based on what I read in this summary it&#8217;s not surprising that the &#8216;tables&#8217; out there don&#8217;t have many name tents with &#8216;L&amp;D&#8217; on&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Before I provide specific examples I&#8217;d like to offer some context on my viewpoints and philosophy.  I believe that we are currently living/working/playing in a knowledge-based economy, or one in which know-how, experience, networks, tacit knowledge and who you know provide the real competitive advantage to improve efficiency, bring products to market, deliver to clients, etc. &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re in consulting or cement.  Assuming this is true, the approaches used by L&amp;D need to transition to support this new world as well and what I read in the CLO report indicates that they&nbsp;haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There are multiple examples in the summary of ways that L&amp;D departments haven&#8217;t adapted to support a knowledge-based organization in an information society &#8211; from methodologies to analytics to perceptions of the C-level.  Some examples&nbsp;below&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Delivery&nbsp;Methods</strong></p>
<p>In an age where informal learning/knowledge networks/collaboration is known to be the source of the vast majority of learning and information for workers of all types one would think methodologies to support these would be creeping [if not entrenched] into corporate learning portfolios.  Rather, formal classroom training &#8220;clearly remains the most common method used.&#8221;  In a close second place, &#8220;the combination of live and self-paced e-learning is the second-most common delivery modality used by&nbsp;organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nature of learning &#8216;delivery&#8217; is flawed from the start when a knowledge economy dominates the market.  Organizations that commit most of their L&amp;D resources to prescribing, designing and delivering everything that their workforce needs to know rather than reallocating those resources to help support and facilitate the exchange of the collective intelligence that already exists are missing a key competitive advantage in the information society.  Dispatch those trainers to begin creating learning histories to prevent brain drain, to act as facilitators/knowledge brokers between geographically dispersed teams with similar objectives or to help redesign the office layout so that informal exchanges can happen more&nbsp;effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Learning&nbsp;Analytics</strong></p>
<p>This section was the most shocking to me.  Not only do the methods being used by most of these organizations sound outdated, the report acknowledges that the metrics [when they're gathered] are proving that they&#8217;re providing little value.  Some notable&nbsp;quotes/stats&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Not surprisingly, little progress  has been made during the past year with the correlation of learning to various other business&nbsp;metrics&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Approximately 1/5 of organizations correlate employee productivity to&nbsp;learning.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Less than 1/10 of organizations correlate extended enterprise performance to learning.&#8221; [umm -&nbsp;wow!]</li>
<li>&#8220;In reality, most organizations measure little beyond the basics, such as course enrollments, completions and learner satisfaction&nbsp;rates.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning &amp; Development&nbsp;Staffing</strong></p>
<p>The report then talks about staffing &#8211; mentioning that &#8220;heads of HR and corporate education and chief learning officers represent the largest groups that believe the enterprise does not have enough staff to support the learning initiatives.&#8221;  What does the C-level think? &#8211; &#8220;only 12 percent of CEOs, COOs and presidents believe the organization does not have enough staff.&#8221;  Based on this chasm in perceptions the report concludes that this &#8220;obviously highlights a lack of communication between learning executives and senior-level business&nbsp;executives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does it really?  If I were an executive at one of these organizations what I would see is our L&amp;D department using methodologies suited for a past era, applying useless analytics to those ineffective methods, complaining because they need more staff and then saying that I&#8217;m out of touch with them because I think they&#8217;re staffed just fine and that I&#8217;ll likely trim their department if we hit a rough patch.  I don&#8217;t blame those executives one bit for their views of these L&amp;D departments.  After all, let&#8217;s review a stat from the Analytics section above &#8211; &#8220;Less than 1/10 of organizations correlate extended enterprise performance to learning.&#8221;  Any other department that boasted those stats would be lucky to have a seat period &#8211; let alone one at the Executive&nbsp;table.</p>
<p><strong>Where to&nbsp;now?</strong></p>
<p>I think this should serve as a wake-up call to the L&amp;D field as a whole &#8211; the world we live and work in has changed&#8230;we need to change with it.  There is a burgeoning field of knowledge management/learning communities/knowledge networks/social networking/workspace design/collaboration/etc. out there that is primed to take on the L&amp;D role in organizations that are preparing themselves to compete in a knowledge society.  The lines between knowledge management and L&amp;D should be becoming very blurry in my opinion.  If not, when you leap for the L&amp;D seat at the table you may land on the lap of someone setting up their KM table&nbsp;tent.</p>

<p>MIT Sloan Management Review has <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/">rebuilt their site</a> using a WordPress platform and is integrating two blogs within it &#8211; one of them focused on innovation.  This is a self-declared work in progress and they are seeking feedback in order to optimize it for their readers.  Go have a look and let them know what you&nbsp;think.</p>
<p>MIT SMR has produced some great material/thinking on approaches to learning, development, knowledge management, learning communities, new-hire integration, leadership development, workspace design and, of course, innovation.  This latest iteration of theirs displays an internal commitment to eat their own dog&nbsp;food.</p>
<p>Incidentally our entire site is built on WordPress and we&#8217;ve really enjoyed its versatility as a Content Management System [CMS].  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the results of MIT&#8217;s new progressive&nbsp;efforts.</p>

<p>CLO Magazine <a href="http://www.clomedia.com/industry_news/2008/November/3813/index.php">just reported on a survey</a> that was done on emerging markets using Web 2.0 tools.  It&#8217;s worth taking a look at their write-up as they have some interesting findings in the&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>The most compelling message to me, though, was that people will be constantly &#8220;wired&#8221; and accustomed to working with these 2.0 tools that many today may feel are foreign.  This will be a critical understanding for the next crop of Chief Learning Officers &#8211; if their workforce of the future is comfortable collaborating in communities and with people all over the world in their personal and professional lives you can bet they&#8217;ll be looking for jobs that allow them to continue that trend.  To take someone of this mindset and stick them in traditional training classes and prevent them from peer-to-peer learning will be doing a large disservice to the workforce, the organization and customers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What opportunities are there in your organization to begin incorporating the Web 2.0 tools slowly before the entire workforce demands it?  Here&#8217;s a hint&#8230;think less about the tools/technology and look for opportunities to help.  If multiple people on a sales team are passing around many drafts of a proposal consider putting it on a wiki until it&#8217;s in final form; if disparate teams are working on common projects/problems/innovations but don&#8217;t know each other a social networking app may be helpful.  Web 2.0 is really just an enabler to get us back to the natural way we want to learn and interact but often&nbsp;can&#8217;t&#8230;</p>

<p>We just toured the new offices of one of our clients and it&#8217;s pretty impressive.  The workspace design certainly incorporates the ability to have impromptu meetings and mixes that with great light, nice views and world-class art thrown in just for&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/othercities/denver/stories/2008/11/10/daily32.html?brthrs=1">write-up on the&nbsp;building</a>.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this space impacts the workforce of this large global organization.  They are beginning to embrace some elements of Learning 2.0 such as communities of practice, knowledge management and social networking and the move to the new digs coincidentally happened at the same time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While I feel strongly that the physical environment has a strong impact on these other areas of informal learning we had absolutely no say in how this building was arranged &#8211; but it&#8217;ll be a nice bonus that we are able to continue our project operating out of such a progressive&nbsp;environment.</p>
