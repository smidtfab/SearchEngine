But it brings them up three to a page, so you have to complete six, over two HITs, to get four right ...<br/><br/>The first one was a Tesco station, selling Esso petrol. The program insisted I was wrong to direct it to the Tesco site, it wanted me to link to exxonmobil.<br/><br/>The second was an independent garage near Pitlochry, which was selling Rix petrol until recently, but is now selling Gulf petrol. I gave the garage's website and was told by the program that I should have linked to the Rix site. What good is that?  They stopped selling Rix ... I said about the Gulf switch in the additional info.<br/><br/>The third was an ASDA station.   The program complained that I should have linked to asda .com - I linked to asda .com/corp/<br/><br/>I gave in and returned the HIT. I had wasted 35 min on a two min task, and the program wanted to train me to give the incorrect answer it already believed.<br/><br/>My connection is slow, and ALL the addresses are incomplete - only just enough to search on.<br/><br/>With a FULL  UK postcode and a street number or name, you could do this really quickly, but the postcodes all lack the last two letters, the addresses lack street numbers.<br/><br/>What gets me about these HITs is the bad design. <br/><br/>If they want the names and telephone numbers, why not just ask for those? <br/>But you have to give the website of the operator.<br/><br/>Why does the program make you give the website of the petroleum supplier when it has asked for the website of the operator?<br/><br/>Why leave the supermarket stations in the list? You cannot sell directly into those sites, anyway. Central purchasing, and there is no sense listing the operator as exxon when you want to talk to Tesco in Cheshunt (all Tesco stations sell Esso). <br/><br/>I don't know the trainee who designed these HITs, but I should have their job and they should be Turking.<br/><br/>For that matter, why don't Dolores Labs make their trainees actually work on MTurk for a week, with an earnings target to aim at?<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Find Petrol (Gas) Station Phone Numbers in UK</b><br/>Post by grrl on Sept 13, 2010, 5:26pm<br/><br/>&quot;...the program wanted to train me to give the incorrect answer it already believed.&quot;<br/>Yes!

I think that's what riles me the most ...<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Find Petrol (Gas) Station Phone Numbers in UK</b><br/>Post by wj123 on Sept 19, 2010, 5:12pm<br/><br/>What a joke, there's more of these up now that say &quot;Fixed&quot; in the hit title, but the postcodes are all still incomplete. I've messaged them so many times about their incorrect formatting of UK addresses and phone numbers, but they never fix them. Why won't they listen to someone who's actually from the UK and actually knows how our addresses and phone numbers should appear? No, they just assume that they're right (DL are always right, after all!).<br/><br/>Also as has been mentioned before, petrol stations in the UK get really confusing - especially when you have one company operating the shop but another company operating the petrol station itself... so you could have e.g. an Esso-owned petrol station with a Tesco-owned shop - or you could have a Tesco-owned petrol station with a Tesco-owned shop which still sells Esso petrol...<br/><br/>They're just far too much work. These hits would need to pay at least 25 cents to make it vaguely worth it - obviously that'll never happen so I just don't do them!<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Find Petrol (Gas) Station Phone Numbers in UK</b><br/>Post by wj123 on Jan 12, 2011, 11:16am<br/><br/>These are back and still broken! And to rub it in, each hit is now THREE pages long but only pays 10 cents. It looks like no one is doing them, I'm not surprised.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Find Petrol (Gas) Station Phone Numbers in UK</b><br/>Post by taintturk on Jan 12, 2011, 6:39pm<br/><br/>SUCH CRAP DL sucks <br/>I miss the old days with them.
