<p>

</p>

<p>Mechanical Turk, part of Amazon's Web Services, is an online
marketplace into for crowdsourced labor. It allows users, called
"providers," to complete human intelligence tasks, or HITs,
offered by "requesters." The requesters pay the providers an
agreed-upon price for each completed HIT. Sharon Chiarella is
vice president of <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and
is in charge Mechanical Turk. She runs the service on a
day-to-day basis, consulting with engineers and customers to
continually improve the service. Chiarella and Kay Kinton, public
relations manager at Amazon, explain a little more about the
service, how it works, and what makes it unique.</p>

<p><b>NELSON ZHANG: Tell us about the origins of Mechanical Turk.
What was its original use? How did it transform into a service
for the public?</b></p>

<p><b>SHARON CHIARELLA:</b> Mechanical Turk, which launched in
2005, began life as a service that Amazon itself needed. Amazon
had millions of web pages that described individual products, and
it wanted to weed out duplicate pages. Software could help, but
algorithmically eliminating all the duplicates was impossible. We
needed an effective way to distribute work to a broad community
of workers.</p>

<p>We realized that many companies had similar tasks, tasks that
humans could do better than computers, so we decided to make it
available as a marketplace where businesses with work, and people
looking to do work, could find each other.</p>

<p>So in short, Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work. Like
other Amazon Web Services [S3 and EC2, for instance], Mechanical
Turk gives businesses and developers access to on-demand,
scalable resources. With S3, it's storage. With Mechanical Turk,
the on-demand, scalable resource is human intelligence.</p>

<p><b>NZ: Is Mechanical Turk profitable to Amazon? How do you
achieve profitability and continue to finance innovation on
Mechanical Turk with its extremely low margins? Are there
intangible benefits?</b></p>

<p><b>KAY KINTON:</b> We don't break out financial results for
Amazon Mechanical Turk. I can say that we're pleased with the
momentum in the business and with feedback from workers and
requesters.</p>

<p><b>NZ: What went into the development of Mechanical Turk? Did
you envision its success from the start or was it more of an
experiment?</b></p>

<p><b>SC:</b> A lot of really talented people, and a lot of
energy and customer feedback, has gone into the development of
Mechanical Turk. We spend a lot of time with
customers&#151;businesses, developers, and workers&#151;to
learn how we can continue to evolve the service.</p>

<p>We knew it was a revolutionary idea. We've been pleased with
the customer feedback and momentum we've seen. Businesses, from
startups to enterprises, are using Mechanical Turk for a broad
range of use cases, everything from web site content management,
to metadata creation, to categorization, to transcription.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p><b>NZ: What's the meaning and significance behind the name
"Mechanical Turk?"</b></p>

<p><b>SC:</b> The name Mechanical Turk is a historical reference
to an 18th century chess-playing device. The original Mechanical
Turk was powered by a human chess player who was hidden inside
the actual device. Typically, a human makes a request of a
computer, and the computer does the computation of the task. But
Mechanical Turk inverts that. The computer has a task that is
easy for a human but extraordinarily hard for the computer. So
instead of calling a computer service to perform the function, it
calls a human. This is reflected in both our service name and our
use of the phrase "artificial, artificial intelligence."</p>

<p><b>NZ: What kind of role would you say Mechanical Turk and the
concept of "artificial artifical intelligence" play in the
development of AI as a field?</b></p>

<p><b>SC:</b> There are still so many things that humans do
better than computers: image recognition, language processing,
translation, transcription, OCR, content creation. These tasks
require human intelligence <i>and</i> Mechanical Turk. We have a
lot of AI researchers who use Mechanical Turk to help them create
clean data to train their AI algorithms.</p>

<p><b>NZ: That sounds like a very interesting alternate use.
Could you tell me how your AI researchers make use of Mechanical
Turk, and some examples of research it has spawned?</b></p>

<p><b>SC:</b> AI researchers have used it for a number of
different cases. Some have used it to create "gold standards,"
which they then use to assess how well their AI algorithms
complete specific tasks. They also use Mechanical Turk to gather
source data. For instance many voice recognition researchers will
use Mechanical Turk to gather diverse voice recordings.</p>

<p>We had one requester upload city and state combinations and
gather recordings of workers saying these names. This gave the
researcher a very broad set of voice clips from workers around
the world. The clips were then used to assess the accuracy of
their voice recognition algorithm.</p>

<p>We also have had researchers use Mechanical Turk to determine
"sentiment" in tweets and forum posts. This data is then used to
"train" the AI algorithm which will monitor posts.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the use cases but I think it gives you
a sense of the breadth of the application.</p>

<p><b>NZ: It seems that with the wealth of data that Mechanical
Turk can provide for training AI, it's possible that users could
reverse that and automate their own work. What is Amazon's policy
on the use of automated bots to complete tasks?</b></p>

<p><b>SC:</b> Workers are not allowed to use automated bots to
submit work. It's against our participation agreement.</p>

<p><b>NZ: Spam is a real problem on Mechanical Turk. Some have
even argued that Mechanical Turk is a market for lemons, where
prices are low exactly because requesters expect quality to be
low. Does Amazon have any plans to track down spam workers, or
will requesters always be responsible for that?</b></p>

<p><b>KK:</b> Accuracy is impacted by a number of things
including the clarity of the instructions and the skill or
qualifications of the worker. The reality is that not every
worker is good at every task. We provide a number of tools for
requesters [businesses] to improve the accuracy of answers they
receive. Many requesters qualify their workers by testing how
well they complete specific tasks. Some requesters use agreement
by multiple workers as a means to assess accuracy. And other
requesters use "gold standards" to test worker's answers. Amazon
does evaluate a workers' performance across all requesters and
does provide feedback to both workers and requesters regarding
quality of work submitted.</p>

<p><b>NZ: What plans does Amazon have to help connect relevant
workers with HITs? Any plans to create sub-Turks where
individuals with specific skills like translation, writing
expertise, or technical prowess can work on tasks matching their
skills? Could Mechanical Turk grow to encompass these new
families of requests or task types?</b></p>

<p><b>KK:</b> Requesters using Mechanical Turk can test worker's
proficiency with their tasks, create their own worker groups, and
direct work to these workers. Requesters do this for work ranging
from transcription to translation to writing and editorial
tasks.</p>

<p><b>NZ: What is Amazon's perspective on labor law
criticism&#151;that many Mechanical Turk workers don't make
minimum wage?</b></p>

<p><b>KK:</b> A worker's pay really depends on what tasks a
worker chooses, how good the work is, and if they are a casual or
a full-time worker. If a task pays $0.02 and takes 10 seconds to
complete, you will be earning $7.20 per hour. If it takes 6
seconds, then a worker would make $12 per hour.</p>

<p>One of the things workers tell us they like about Amazon
Mechanical Turk is that it gives them the flexibility to work as
much or as little as they like, and it gives them a wide variety
of tasks to choose from. In some cases, our workers have told us
that Amazon Mechanical Turk provides much more flexibility than a
traditional work environment.</p>

<p><b>NZ: Could you tell us a bit about your job? What is a day
at work like for you?</b></p>

<p><b>SC:</b> No two days are alike. I might be speaking at a
conference one day and critiquing a new product proposal the
next. I spend time everyday with the engineers and product
managers who are working on new features.</p>

<p>I also spend time every day with customers. For instance I may
have a conference call with a new customer to understand their
use case or might meet with a partner who is helping businesses
integrate Mechanical Turk into their business applications. I
also talk with workers to get their thoughts on features,
requesters and HITs in the system. I do HITs to see what work is
in the system, and then check out <a
href="http://turkernation.com">turkernation.com</a> to see what
workers are saying about specific HITs and requesters. I really
learn a lot from these interactions.</p>
