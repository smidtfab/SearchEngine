<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Computational social science is an emerging academic research area
at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and the social
sciences, in which quantitative methods and computational tools are
used to identify and answer social science questions. The field is
driven by new sources of data from the Internet, sensor networks,
government databases, crowdsourcing systems, and more, as well as by
recent advances in computational modeling, machine learning,
statistics, and social network analysis. The related area of social
computing deals with the mechanisms through which people interact with
computational systems, examining how and why people contribute to
crowdsourcing sites, and the Internet more generally. Examples of
social computing systems include prediction markets, reputation
systems, and collaborative filtering systems, all designed with the
intent of capturing the wisdom of crowds. Machine learning plays in
important role in both of these research areas, but to make truly
groundbreaking advances, collaboration is necessary: social scientists
and economists are uniquely positioned to identify the most pertinent
and vital questions and problems, as well as to provide insight into
data generation, while computer scientists are able to contribute
significant expertise in developing novel, quantitative methods and
tools. To date there have been few in-person venues for researchers in
these traditionally disparate areas to interact. This workshop will
address this need, with an emphasis on machine learning. The primary
goals of the workshop are to provide an opportunity for attendees to
meet, interact, share ideas, establish new collaborations, and to
inform the wider NIPS community about current research in
computational social science and social computing.</p>

<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>

<p>We welcome contributions on both theoretical models and empirical
work, as well as everything in between, including but not limited to
the following areas of research:</p>

<ul>

<li>Automatic aggregation of opinions or knowledge</li>

<li>Prediction markets / information markets</li>

<li>Incentives in social computation (e.g., games with a purpose)</li>

<li>Studies of events and trends (e.g., in politics)</li>

<li>Analysis of and experiments on distributed collaboration and
consensus-building, including crowdsourcing (e.g., Mechanical Turk)
and peer-production systems (e.g., Wikipedia)</li>

<li>Group dynamics and decision-making</li>

<li>Modeling network interaction content (e.g., text analysis of blog posts, tweets, emails, etc.)</li>

<li>Social networks</li>

</ul>

<h3>Paper Submission</h3>

<p>Papers may be up to four pages long including references and must
be in the <a href="http://nips.cc/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS
2010 format</a>. Papers should not be anonymized (i.e., you should
uncomment or add <tt>\nipsfinalcopy</tt> in your .tex file prior to
submitting). Accepted papers will be made available on the workshop
website. However, the workshop's proceedings can be considered
non-archival, meaning contributors are free to publish their work in
archival journals or conferences. Accepted papers will be either
presented as a talk or poster. Paper submissions should be emailed to
<em>both</em> wallach at cs umass edu and jenn at cs ucla edu with a
subject line of "NIPS CSS 2010: XXX" where "XXX" is the title of the
submission.</p>

<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<li><b>Submission deadline:</b> October 8, 2010</li>

<li><b>Notification of acceptance:</b> November 1, 2010</li>

<li><b>Final versions of accepted papers due:</b> November 29, 2010</li>
