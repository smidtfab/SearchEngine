          <p class="moreleading">After completing the
            Mechanical Olympics in the summer of 2008 utilizing workers on
            the Mechanical Turk website, I realized I wasn&#8217;t finished
            working with the Mechanical Turk workers. 
            For pennies, it is possible to create
            information exchange that promotes interpretation and independent
            thinking among an international workforce.</p>

          all of my experiments with elastic workforce on mturk.com.</p></td>

       <td align="center" valign="top" class="bodytxt"><p class="txtwbg">Happy
           Birthday!<a href="mailto:xtine@missconceptions.net"></a></p>
         <p class="bodytxt">In March 2009, I sent birthday greetings using the
           Mechanical Turk workforce. </p>
         I saved the three bucks I would have spent on a Hallmark card and used it, instead, to send three dollars worth of "Happy Birthday" messages from the Mechanical Turk workers.

The truth is, I never buy cards anyhow. Still, this was a lot better than some made-up thing I would have put together in so much time - and I'm considered an "expert" at using paper, scissors, graphics and glue to create visual messages.

So, I went to mturk.com, signed in as a requester, and left the following instructions for my workers:
<blockquote>For his birthday, I'm sending my boyfriend "Happy Birthday" emails from Mechanical Turk workers. This is super easy - here are the directions:

Send him an email wishing him a happy birthday. You can adlib within the message, wishing him a good day, good luck this year, or tell him that his girlfriend loves him...you know, birthday well wishes. (The email address was inserted here).

I promise that I/he will not to share your email address or use it for any purpose.
One last rule - only one email per person. It's more fun if he gets a set of totally different messages. Thank you!</blockquote>
We woke up today and I couldn't wait to have him check his email. Playing it cool is not my best skill. Here are some of the messages he received:
<blockquote>
  <p>"Hope you have a good time and enjoy every second of your day. And may this year be 10x better than any other year so far :) Happy Birthday"  </p>
  <p>"Happy Birth Day to you. Many Many Happy Returns Of the Day"    </p>
  <p>"Happy Birthday!  I hope you have an awesome year and it is full of love and hugs and kisses and more!  Enjoy yourself!"    </p>
  <p>"How lucky you are to have a girlfriend that cares som much about you that
    she wants people worldwide to greet you on this historical day for you. 
    I hope this day is wonderful, I hope this year is magical. Have a teriffic
    Birthday."</p>
</blockquote>
I have to say, for the price of a card, you get a lot more fun out of seeing what people from all over the world write to your loved ones; <em>and</em> it's
even better when they tell your boyfriend/spouse/loved ones just how great you
are for sponsoring their messages. I haven't seen a card with this kind of message
yet.
