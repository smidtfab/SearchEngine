<h3 align="center">Undergraduate Research Project Description Spring 2011</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><br />Professor Peter Bickel and Post Doc Ben Brown</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">(Deadline: March 8th, 2011)</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The CAGE assay (cap analysis of gene expression) is used to identify the 5' end of transcribed genes in many genomics consortia, including ENCODE, modENCODE, and the FANTOM Project.  However, there exist in live cells many types of capped RNAs other than full length mRNA transcripts, and these are also identified by the CAGE assay.  We are interested in clustering and classifying CAGE signal using aggregative techniques.  In particular, we want to identify CAGE signals that correspond to cytoplasmic recapping events.  The first step in this process will be the clustering of the CAGE data into various shape and sequence-based classes.  We have a preliminary code base to execute this, and need a student to lead the analysis and develop the analytical pipeline.  Extensive consultation with computational biologists will be available throughout the project.  Extensive experience with Python is essential for work on this project. This project has the potential to lead to multiple publications.<br /><br /></p>

<h4 align="center">Counting Civilian Casualties in Times of War and Conflict</h4>
<h4 align="center">(Deadline: January 27, 2011)</h4>
Professor Nicholas P. Jewell</div>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Estimates of civilian casualties associated with the current war in Iraq have proven to be extremely controversial. The statistical techniques used to date are all subject to various biases and suffer from differing levels of precision. Currently I am researching historical approaches to counting civilian casualties, focusing on the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Vietnam and Korean Wars, in order to give perspective on, and contrast with, methods used in Iraq.</p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">In addition, I am doing some basic statistical analyses of information from the WikiLeaks war logs and data from the Truth Commission in Peru (CVR). This project would thus involve both historical research and some statistical investigation.</p>
<hr />
<div align="center">
<h4 align="center">Identifying Genes and Signaling Cascades in Pathways</h4>
<h4 align="center">(Deadline: January 27, 2011)</h4>
Professor Haiyan Huang</div>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">The series of chemical reactions, also known as biological pathways, form an integral and critical part of every biological process. Studying pathways and involved genes is therefore an important step toward understanding a biological system. However, genes cooperating in the same biological pathway can have explicit direct relationships or implicit indirect relationships. Identifying implicit indirect relationships is very challenging, and this has been a critical obstacle in pathway studies. By making use of the growing mass of costly-to-generate yet freely available gene expression data, this project aims to elucidate the genes&rsquo; indirect relationships and their expression cascades in a pathway of interest. This is a collaborative project with the Feldman lab in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology on campus. Requirements: motivation and interest in bioinformatics research, R programming skills, and Statistics 134, and 135.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Language processing for visual summarization of news</h4>
<h4 align="center">(Deadline: January 27, 2011)</h4>
<p style="font-size: 90%; text-align: center;">Professors Bin Yu and Laurent El Ghaoui and Graduate students Garvesh Raskutti and Luke Miratrix</p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Are you interested in information retrieval or computational linguistics? News media has a profound impact on the opinions and decision-making of individuals and organizations large and small. Given the vast amount of news data available today, an informative and automatic visual summary would potentially allow for informed decisions and opinions to be formed more easily. The aim of our project is to create visual summaries of large-scale news corpuses from the US and other parts of the world.   To help us with this, we are looking for an undergraduate student who can implement and extend off-the-shelf algorithms that tag important phrases in the news such as people, places, organizations, sentiment phrases etc. with a view to creating useful news summarizers.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Bibliographic Data Analysis</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">(Deadline: January 27, 2011)</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">Professor Jim Pitman</p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">This project involves various aspects of structured text data processing and analysis, statistical modeling, programming, machine learning, and graphical visualization. One or more undergraduates will be expected to work in collaboration with a team of graduate students and visiting researchers with similar interests. Knowledge of either Java or python, and some acquaintance with R, will be required.  Students without statistical background but with strong database and programming skills may apply.</p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Starting from a particular bibliographic record in a local collection, a basic problem is to efficiently find and retrieve all records in some remote collection which are related to the initial record in specified ways. General methods, data structures, and interfaces to manage this task, need to be developed. The type of relation (e.g. same or similar title, different versions of the same document, same author, same subject, ...), and the likelihood of correctness of assertions of such a relation given observed records, can be assessed by methods of machine learning. Specific activities will include review and evaluation of existing methods for efficient record matching in bibliographic and similar contexts (e.g. medical records), and development of new methods as may be necessary for specific applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Assessing the rate at which articles in the arXiv preprint repository <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arxiv.org/">http://arxiv.org/</a> are published after some delay in journals. How does the distribution of this delay depend on the arXiv subject categories. Is this distribution changing over time within a single category?  Answering this question requires acceptably reliable record matching, as matching errors may significantly effect conclusions of the study.</li>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Assessing the overlap and coverage of various bibliographic resources in probability and statistics, including MathSciNet, ZMATH, CIS, WorldCat, Open Library, Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, by systematic random sampling and matching of records between databases. </li>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Developing and assessing the efficiency of various semi-automated methods of finding homepages of authors, starting from bibliographic information in some number of articles they have written.</li>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Similar activities for matching author profiles provided by different bibliographic authorities.</li>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Matching of citations with bibliographic records as needed for citation analysis</li>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Graphical display of bibliographic networks associated with citation and collaboration relations, and the effect of matching errors on the structure of such networks. </li>
<li style="font-size: 90%;">Use of crowdsourcing to assist with automation of bibliographic matching and classification tasks.</li>
</ul>
