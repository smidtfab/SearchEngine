var metadata = {"abstract":"This paper investigates the phenomena of \"crowdsourcing\", or the outsourcing of tasks to the general internet public. This phenomenon was made possible by technological innovations associated with \"Web 2.0\" but is evidence of historically significant change in the relations between firms and their customers. We are witnessing the emergence of a new consumer type: the \"working consumer\". In the conventional role, consumers were passive to be waited upon. Consumers now are becoming more like co-workers who take over specific parts of a production process, whereby this process ultimately remains under the control of a commercial enterprise. This article seeks a more precise definition of crowdsourcing, catalogues some of its forms, and differentiates them from peripherally related phenomena. It ends with a discussion regarding potential consequences (negative and positive) of crowdsourcing for the future organization of work.","website":"http:\/\/www.sti-studies.de\/fileadmin\/articles\/kleemannetalstivol4no1.pdf","stats":{"academic_status":{"7":1,"5":1,"11":1},"readers":3,"discipline":{"93":1,"101":1,"411":1},"country":{"United States":1,"":1,"Japan":1}},"issue":"1","pages":"5-26","public_file_hash":"eb2b2979a0bf561d1cc209483e07120286fbe5f3","published_in":"Science Technology Innovation Studies","type":"journal","url":"underpaid-innovators-commercial-utilization-consumer-work-through-crowdsourcing","id":"8f769970-6d06-11df-afb8-0026b95d30b2","authors":[{"forename":"F","surname":"Kleemann"},{"forename":"G G\u00fcnter Vo\u00dfand Kerstin","surname":"Rieder"},{"forename":"K","surname":"Rieder"}],"fingerprint":617086640545753472,"title":"Un(der)paid Innovators: The Commercial Utilization of Consumer Work through Crowdsourcing","volume":"4","year":2008,"categories":[411,101,93],"groups":[{"profile_id":1209261,"date_added":1274782049000,"group_id":266501}],"file_hash":"eb2b2979a0bf561d1cc209483e07120286fbe5f3","profile_ids":[2333221,1209261,3160421],"oa_journal":false,"fullUrl":"\/research\/underpaid-innovators-commercial-utilization-consumer-work-through-crowdsourcing\/","openurl":"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fmendeley.com%2Fmendeley&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.volume=4&rft.issue=1&rft.pages=5-26&rft.atitle=Un%28der%29paid+Innovators%3A+The+Commercial+Utilization+of+Consumer+Work+through+Crowdsourcing&rft.jtitle=Science+Technology+Innovation+Studies&rft.aulast=Kleemann&rft.auinit1=F&rft.au=Rieder%2C+G+G%C3%BCnter+Vo%C3%9Fand+Kerstin&rft.au=Rieder%2C+K"};

		<p>This paper investigates the phenomena of &quot;crowdsourcing&quot;, or the outsourcing of tasks to the general internet public. This phenomenon was made possible by technological innovations associated with &quot;Web 2.0&quot; but is evidence of historically significant change in the relations between firms and their customers. We are witnessing the emergence of a new consumer type: the &quot;working consumer&quot;. In the conventional role, consumers were passive to be waited upon. Consumers now are becoming more like co-workers who take over specific parts of a production process, whereby this process ultimately remains under the control of a commercial enterprise. This article seeks a more precise definition of crowdsourcing, catalogues some of its forms, and differentiates them from peripherally related phenomena. It ends with a discussion regarding potential consequences (negative and positive) of crowdsourcing for the future organization of work.</p>

Abstract <br />
This paper investigates the phenomena of &quot;crowdsourcing&quot;, or the outsourcing of <br />
tasks to the general internet public. This phenomenon was made possible by tech-<br />
nological innovations associated with &quot;Web 2.0&quot; but is evidence of historically sig-<br />
nificant change in the relations between firms and their customers. We are witness-<br />
ing the emergence of a new consumer type: the &quot;working consumer&quot;. In the con-<br />
ventional role, consumers were passive “kings” to be waited upon. Consumers now <br />
are becoming more like co-workers who take over specific parts of a production <br />
process, whereby this process ultimately remains under the control of a commercial <br />
enterprise. This article seeks a more precise definition of crowdsourcing, catalogues <br />
some of its forms, and differentiates them from peripherally related phenomena. It <br />
ends with a discussion regarding potential consequences (negative and positive) of <br />
crowdsourcing for the future organization of work. <br />

1 Introduction <br />
Crowdsourcing, as argued in this arti-<br />
cle, takes place when a profit oriented <br />
firm outsources specific tasks essential <br />
for the making or sale of its product to <br />
the general public (the crowd) in the <br />
form of an open call over the internet, <br />
with the intention of animating indi-<br />
viduals to make a contribution to the <br />
firm&#039;s production process for free or <br />
for significantly less than that contri-<br />
bution is worth to the firm. Firms en-<br />
gage in crowdsourcing to inexpensively <br />
mobilize the creative work of some-<br />
times highly skilled persons as a re-<br />
source for the generation of value and <br />
profits. Tasks that lend themselves to <br />
crowdsourcing include product design, <br />
advertising, quality monitoring, and <br />
the solution of specific technical prob-<br />
lems. <br />
Crowdsourcing has been made possible <br />
on a large scale by the emergence of <br />
&quot;Web 2.0,&quot; a shorthand term for new <br />
internet applications that make two-<br />
way communication easier to manage. <br />
This article examines the phenomena <br />
of crowdsourcing in Web 2.0 and re-<br />
flects on its ramifications for the or-<br />
ganization of work and society. <br />
The following section examines the <br />
wider context of change in corporate-<br />
consumer relations. The emergence of <br />
a new type of consumer, the &quot;working <br />
consumer,&quot; is discussed as a theoreti-<br />
cal preliminary for understanding the <br />
specific phenomenon of crowdsourc-<br />
ing. Reflections on a more precise <br />
definition of crowdsourcing are pre-<br />
sented below (in section 3.1) together <br />
with an examination of the technical <br />
prerequisites (3.2) for its various types <br />
(3.3), with the caveat that it should not <br />
be conflated with related forms of in-<br />
teractive participation now common <br />
on the internet (3.4). <br />
Voluntary participation in crowdsourc-<br />
ing tasks is currently very popular <br />
among internet users. Possible motiva-<br />
tions driving individual participation <br />
and other factors that explain the ris-<br />
ing prevalence of crowdsourcing, in-<br />
cluding the motives of firms who initi-<br />
ate it, are discussed below (4). By way <br />
of conclusion (5), some potential fu-<br />
ture consequences of crowdsourcing <br />
for firms and consumers are reflected <br />
upon. <br />
2 The Working Consumer <br />
A functional differentiation of society <br />
into two dichotomous spheres of &quot;pro-<br />
duction&quot; and &quot;consumption&quot; is an arti-<br />
fact of early industrial society. The role <br />
of the consumer in this dichotomy is <br />
royally passive: consumers buy and use <br />
products, and that is all. Even in the <br />
act of buying they are waited on. <br />
Self-service emerged much later in the <br />
history of consumption. Department <br />
stores in which customers were al-<br />
lowed to handle the stock themselves <br />
and vending machines first appeared <br />
at the end of the nineteenth century in <br />
the United States (Porter Benson 1988; <br />
König 2000). These changes reached <br />
Europe shortly afterwards and became <br />
widespread in the 1950s. Self-service <br />
first became commonplace in grocery <br />
stores, but by the 1970s companies like <br />
IKEA and fast-food chains widely ex-<br />
panded its use. Self-service principles <br />
started to become prevalent in many <br />
other areas of retailing like home im-<br />
provement, pharmacy, and automotive <br />
supply at this time too.  <br />
Since the 1990s, the internet has been <br />
playing an important role in expanding <br />
forms of cooperation between firms <br />
and consumers in the production proc-<br />
ess. The internet revolution, which has <br />
left its &quot;e-&quot; footprint on many areas of <br />
the public sphere (e-government, e-<br />
commerce, e-banking, etc.), is not only <br />
about new technical possibilities of <br />
communication. Consumers are also <br />
being given increasing degrees of re-<br />
sponsibility for service provision, e.g. <br />
in the health sector (Rieder 2005).  <br />
Considered in light of the history of <br />
industrial society, relations between <br />
firms and consumers recently have <br />
undergone far-reaching changes in-<br />
deed. Consumers have ceased to be <br />

merely passive takers of goods and <br />
services provided by company employ-<br />
ees. Rather, they increasingly take part <br />
in firms&#039; production and service deliv-<br />
ery processes actively and directly. <br />
Consumers have become more like co-<br />
workers, who take over specific parts of <br />
a production process that ultimately <br />
remains under the control of a com-<br />
mercial enterprise. <br />
Voß and Rieder (2005) interpret this <br />
development as the emergence of a <br />
new consumer type: the &quot;working con-<br />
sumer&quot; (“arbeitender Kunde”). The <br />
literal translation of &quot;Kunde&quot; is &quot;cus-<br />
tomer,&quot; but the broader term “con-<br />
sumer” is more appropriate, because it <br />
encompasses a more complete range of <br />
relationships and conventions that <br />
define and regulate the firm&#039;s dealings <br />
with outside individuals. <br />
Although consumer research has paid <br />
little attention to fundamental changes <br />
in corporate-consumer relations (cf. <br />
Scherhorn 1977; Rosenkranz/Schnei-<br />
der 2000), other research traditions <br />
began to draw attention to these phe-<br />
nomena in the 1970s. Three separate <br />
research perspectives have each sepa-<br />
rately investigated different aspects of <br />
the active participation of consumers.  <br />
Sociology and economics look at con-<br />
sumer behaviour as a part and out-<br />
come of larger social and economic <br />
transformations. Research into the <br />
tertiarization of the economy, coupled <br />
with the realization that the coopera-<br />
tion of consumers is often necessary <br />
for the provision of services, gave an <br />
important impetus for investigations of <br />
consumers&#039; &quot;coproduction&quot; activities <br />
(Gross/Badura 1977; Gartner/Riess-<br />
man 1974). Around the same time, <br />
feminists called attention to similari-<br />
ties between paid and non-paid work <br />
(Hausen 1978; Ostner 1978; Krell <br />
1984). Active consumption became <br />
more and more widely investigated <br />
beginning in the early 1980s. One cen-<br />
tral term emerging at this time was <br />
&quot;prosumers&quot; (Toffler 1980), who are <br />
persons who consume what they pro-<br />
duce themselves. Other concepts were <br />
&quot;do-it-yourself&quot; work (Offe/Heinze <br />
1990) and &quot;the work of consuming&quot; <br />
(Joerges 1981). Another core concept <br />
was &quot;McDonaldization,&quot; first men-<br />
tioned by Ritzer (1983), which is the <br />
rationalization of service routines <br />
whereby consumers are expected to <br />
perform certain essential steps.  <br />
Whereas sociology and economics fo-<br />
cused on the linkages of consumer be-<br />
haviour to broad social change, the <br />
management literature concerns itself <br />
with the practical matter of developing <br />
recommendations for firms dealing <br />
with the active consumer. As early as <br />
the 1970s and in the context of reflec-<br />
tions on the transition to the service <br />
economy, a central question was how <br />
to integrate so-called external produc-<br />
tion factors (consumers in this case) <br />
into service provision and what risks <br />
were involved in doing so (Love-<br />
lock/Young 1979; Maleri 1994). Get-<br />
ting customers involved in production <br />
processes was an important issue also <br />
for manufacturing firms, for example <br />
in the widely touted concept of the <br />
&quot;virtual corporation&quot; wherein the focus <br />
was on business customers in particu-<br />
lar (Davidow/Malone 1992). The con-<br />
sumer was discovered as a central re-<br />
source for corporations, which were <br />
advised to treat “customer develop-<br />
ment” as seriously as personnel devel-<br />
opment (Gouthier/Schmid 2001; <br />
Gouthier 2003). One began to speak of <br />
&quot;outsourcing to the customer&quot; and <br />
even to think of customers as &quot;service <br />
providers&quot; (cf. Grün/Brunner 2002). <br />
Recent work conceptualizes consumers <br />
as joint participants with the firm in <br />
value creation (Reichwald/Piller <br />
2006).  <br />
A third research tradition examines <br />
consumer behaviour from the perspec-<br />
tive of role theory. Parsons (1951) pio-<br />
neered this approach with his reflec-<br />
tions on the complementary roles of <br />
doctors and patients. Using the &quot;ser-<br />
vice encounters&quot; approach of the man-<br />
agement literature, researchers began <br />
looking at variation in consumers&#039; ac-<br />
tive roles in various types of services <br />
(Czepiel/Solomon/Suprenant 1985; <br />

 <br />
Mohr/Bitner 1991). This research <br />
made clear that the quality of service <br />
provision depends just as much on <br />
how well consumers play their roles as <br />
on how well employees play theirs. <br />
Over time, both sets of roles were less <br />
often described as complementary and <br />
more often as similar. Consumers are <br />
thought of as &quot;partial&quot; employees <br />
(Mills/Morris 1986) or unpaid em-<br />
ployees (Nerdinger 1994). Roles even <br />
come to be understood as interchange-<br />
able: &quot;Employees as customers, cus-<br />
tomers as employees&quot; (Bow-<br />
ers/Martin/Luker 1990). The impor-<br />
tance of digital technology was often <br />
noted as a precondition for many new <br />
forms of self-service, as in the example <br />
of observations of services offered by <br />
mobile telecommunications compa-<br />
nies. A &quot;new type of prosumer&quot; was <br />
discovered among cell phone service <br />
users, whose activities and skills are <br />
very similar to those of the information <br />
technology professionals who nomi-<br />
nally provide those services (Hane-<br />
kop/Tasch/Wittke 2001: 91; Hanekop/ <br />
Wittke 2005). Other studies showed <br />
that consumers often do not have the <br />
skills one would expect of employees <br />
and that consumers are often con-<br />
fronted with unsatisfactory &quot;working <br />
conditions&quot; (Dunkel/Voß 2004). <br />
It is characteristic of this literature that <br />
the active consumer is not treated as a <br />
subject in its own right but rather tan-<br />
gentially, by way of answering ques-<br />
tions of internal significance to each of <br />
the individual research traditions. Voß <br />
and Rieder (2005) made an effort to <br />
overcome disciplinary boundaries in <br />
their review and synthesis of these <br />
separate literatures, summarizing their <br />
findings in what they call the working <br />
consumer thesis:  <br />
Firms are shifting a wide array of <br />
previously internal capacities and <br />
functions onto their own customers, <br />
consumers in general, and other non-<br />
employees. This trend is affecting an <br />
increasing number of areas and is <br />
being conducted increasingly system-<br />
atically.  <br />
Currently, a pronounced increase in <br />
the instances of outsourcing to non-<br />
employees can be observed even as the <br />
forms and prevalence of self-service in <br />
all branches of commerce and industry <br />
are multiplying (Rieder/Laupper <br />
2007). Examples are ticket machines <br />
and online ticket sales in public trans-<br />
portation, e-shopping and self-<br />
scanning in retail, and in the wide <br />
range of transactions in tourism, bank-<br />
ing, and investment that individuals <br />
can carry out via the internet. All of <br />
these self-service activities cut firms&#039; <br />
personnel needs – and related costs – <br />
significantly. <br />
Yet the quantitative increase of out-<br />
sourcing to non-employees is not as <br />
interesting as the qualitative changes it <br />
is bringing about. Indeed, we are wit-<br />
nessing a new phenomenon in the his-<br />
tory of commerce and industry. Non-<br />
employees (customers, consumers, <br />
clients, patients, patrons, citizens, etc.) <br />
are fulfilling functions and providing <br />
capacities in the value creation proc-<br />
ess, usually for free. These capacities <br />
can be and are being exploited com-<br />
mercially. For instance, customers of <br />
amazon.com advise other customers by <br />
writing product reviews, uploading <br />
lists of favourite books, and rating the <br />
reliability of private sellers. More ex-<br />
amples are discussed below. <br />
On the basis of these empirical devel-<br />
opments, one can speculate that the <br />
working consumer thesis implies a <br />
long-term, fundamental change in the <br />
social relations of production. What <br />
might these changes look like? <br />
Possibly, &quot;consumers&quot; as we currently <br />
conceive them will simply disappear. <br />
The current notion of consumers arose <br />
in conjunction with industrialization <br />
and is characterized by the act of con-<br />
suming as opposed to the act of work. <br />
In its place we may see a new, hybrid <br />
figure arise – that of the &quot;working con-<br />
sumer&quot; (Voß/Rieder 2005). Three <br />
characteristics of the working con-<br />
sumer that go beyond mere consump-<br />
tion are central to an ideal-typical <br />
definition: a) working consumers are <br />

active in the production process and <br />
can be utilized as value-adding work-<br />
ers; b) the capacities they possess are <br />
valuable economic assets; and c) they <br />
are systematically integrated into cor-<br />
porate structures, where their actions <br />
can be monitored and manipulated by <br />
corporate managers much as if they <br />
were employees. <br />
The examples of corporate outsourcing <br />
to consumers noted above may repre-<br />
sent the beginning of wider changes in <br />
firm-consumer relations. Placed in <br />
macroeconomic perspective, we can <br />
speculate on the emergence of a new, <br />
expanded logic of the commercial ex-<br />
ploitation of labour in the value crea-<br />
tion process. Managers and investors <br />
are now beginning – explicitly and <br />
systematically – to tap into a new and <br />
previously untouched sphere of latent <br />
assets in the pursuit of profit. Of <br />
course, not every aspect of this activity <br />
is new. Corporations have always <br />
availed themselves of the capacities of <br />
workers whom they do not hold in <br />
their employ, as shown by many exam-<br />
ples of home work. However, home <br />
workers were only indirectly influ-<br />
enced by the organization of the firm <br />
itself, if at all. New now is that firms <br />
are systematically building into their <br />
own strategic planning the commercial <br />
utilization of the productive capacity of <br />
persons who are completely outside <br />
the formal framework regulating cor-<br />
porate employees and suppliers. If one <br />
is so inclined, this development can be <br />
characterized as a further encroach-<br />
ment of capitalism into an area of so-<br />
cial life that until now had been un-<br />
touched by economic rationality. <br />
 One can postulate the beginnings of a <br />
new form of socialization of the indi-<br />
vidual through work, or rather through <br />
forms of unpaid or insufficiently re-<br />
munerated work for firms in the capac-<br />
ity of a &quot;consumer&quot;. In the future, peo-<br />
ple&#039;s identities may be influenced as <br />
much by these kinds of activities as <br />
they are now shaped by what they do in <br />
their regular jobs. In the place of the <br />
&quot;long arm of the job,&quot; which reaches <br />
deep into the personal lives of employ-<br />
ees, we may get two long arms: the arm <br />
of the job and the arm of consumer <br />
work. In the process, the corporation <br />
stands to obtain greater access to the <br />
capacities of workers than ever before, <br />
thus increasing the individual&#039;s de-<br />
pendency on corporate structures. <br />
Corporations may also be affected <br />
negatively by these developments. The <br />
new kind of dependency emerging <br />
from changes in customer relations is <br />
not a one-way street. Corporations now <br />
depend on working consumers to carry <br />
out their &quot;jobs&quot; reliably and in accor-<br />
dance with the plans and needs of the <br />
firm. Thus, the rise of consumer work <br />
entails dangers and risks for both indi-<br />
viduals and firms. <br />
3 Crowdsourcing in Web 2.0 <br />
3.1 Towards a Precise Definition <br />
of Crowdsourcing <br />
The term crowdsourcing, was coined <br />
by Jeff Howe (2006) in the computer <br />
magazine Wired. In his original article, <br />
crowdsourcing meant for him &quot;[t]he <br />
new pool of cheap labour: everyday <br />
people using their spare [resources] to <br />
create content, solve problems, even do <br />
corporate R &amp; D. &quot; <br />
Perhaps the most widely read recep-<br />
tion of the crowdsourcing concept in <br />
the German language is that of Reich-<br />
wald and Piller (2006), who place the <br />
phenomenon in an economics frame-<br />
work. They suggest the use of the term <br />
&quot;interaktive Wertschöpfung&quot; (interac-<br />
tive value creation) as a synonym for <br />
crowdsourcing. In fact, they define <br />
interactive value creation in exactly the <br />
same way that Howe now defines <br />
crowdsourcing. For both, it is &quot;the act <br />
of taking a job traditionally performed <br />
by a designated agent (usually an em-<br />
ployee) and outsourcing it to an unde-<br />
fined, generally large group of people <br />
in the form of an open call&quot; (Howe <br />
2007; Piller/Reichwald/Ihl 2007: 87). <br />
Tasks outsourced in this manner can <br />
be tied to innovation (the creation of <br />
new knowledge) or to operational ac-<br />
tivities such as marketing or the con-<br />
 <br />

                                                <div class="plaintext">10 STI Studies 2008: 5-26 <br />
 <br />
figuration of a product. In every case, <br />
however, the act of value creation is <br />
changed from a firm-dominated proc-<br />
ess to a process of co-production in-<br />
volving the active participation of cus-<br />
tomers and other internet users. This <br />
approach is virtually identical to Voß <br />
and Rieder&#039;s (2005) concept of the <br />
working consumer, which describes a <br />
new division of labour between firms <br />
and consumers such that consumers <br />
become active participants in the crea-<br />
tion of value. Reichwald and Piller <br />
(2006) look to cost-benefit issues to <br />
better understand crowdsourcing and <br />
its recent rise; they stress that crowd-<br />
sourcing is possible only when its costs <br />
are low and the requisite interaction <br />
brings benefits to all participants. <br />
Reichwald and Piller (2006) differenti-<br />
ate between what they consider to be <br />
two forms of crowdsourcing: &quot;mass <br />
customization&quot; and &quot;open innovation&quot;. <br />
Mass customization refers to the en-<br />
hancement of operations so as to en-<br />
able single purchasers to buy a product <br />
personalized for them alone. Open <br />
innovation, on the other hand, refers to <br />
cooperation between a firm and its <br />
customers in the development of a new <br />
product for the &quot;benefit&quot; of a larger <br />
circle of potential buyers.  <br />
At this point it becomes clear that the <br />
way, in which Reichwald and Piller <br />
define &quot;interactive value creation&quot;, is <br />
too broad to be used synonymously for <br />
crowdsourcing because of their inclu-<br />
sion of the phenomena of mass cus-<br />
tomization. Mass customization refers <br />
to the isolated activity of individual <br />
customers as directed toward one unit <br />
of the product, not to the collective <br />
activity of many individuals as directed <br />
toward a general product type. Yet, <br />
central to the concept of crowdsourc-<br />
ing is the idea that a crowd of people, <br />
collaboratively (or at least simultane-<br />
ously) contribute to an aspect of the <br />
production process or to the solution <br />
of a design issue or other problems. <br />
Their concept of &quot;open innovation&quot; – <br />
and it alone – corresponds to the <br />
meaning of crowdsourcing as under-<br />
stood here. <br />
Another difficulty with Reichwald and <br />
Piller&#039;s (2006) definition is their asser-<br />
tion that individuals who respond to <br />
crowdsourcing calls must derive some <br />
kind of benefit from doing so. From a <br />
rational choice perspective, this con-<br />
clusion is axiomatic. Since participa-<br />
tion is voluntary, individuals partici-<br />
pate only if they perceive that the <br />
benefits of doing so (however these <br />
may be defined subjectively) outweigh <br />
the costs. The problematic possibility <br />
that firms may be able to manipulate <br />
individuals&#039; cost-benefit calculations <br />
falls outside of the paradigm. Yet, cor-<br />
porate consultants openly discuss <br />
crowdsourcing as a model in which <br />
participating consumers get absolutely <br />
no benefit from their participation. <br />
Examples include the use of corporate <br />
homepages to prompt customers to <br />
submit suggestions for improvement, <br />
new designs, and ideas. Customers <br />
who submit their ideas rarely receive <br />
adequate financial compensation for <br />
the work involved in doing so. <br />
3.2 Technical Prerequisites for <br />
Crowdsourcing: Web 2.0 <br />
The term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; refers to internet <br />
applications that make possible new <br />
forms of interactive communication <br />
that go beyond conventional sender-<br />
receiver models. These types of appli-<br />
cations are used for a wide variety of <br />
content and purposes including audio, <br />
reviews, bookmarks, communities, <br />
files, films, photos, graphics, instant <br />
messaging, jobs, personal contacting, <br />
art, music, news, podcasts, program-<br />
ming, travel, shopping, games, sports, <br />
search engines, tagging, texts, tools, <br />
video, weblogs, wiki, and knowledge. <br />
The high popularity of these applica-<br />
tions among internet users indicates <br />
that they are tapping into a widespread <br />
yearning for active participation. The <br />
initial impetus for Web 2.0 program-<br />
ming came from the anti-commercial <br />
&quot;open-source&quot; movement, but the cor-<br />
porate world has since discovered it as <br />
a platform for its own goals. <br />
&quot;Web 2.0,&quot; a neologism that dates to <br />
2004, does not signify a technological <br />
 <br />

 <br />

or organizational advance in the infra-<br />
structure of the World Wide Web in its <br />
entirety. Rather, it refers to the in-<br />
creased prevalence of broadband con-<br />
nections coupled with the emergence <br />
of applications made possible by nu-<br />
merous software innovations such as <br />
content management systems and &quot;dy-<br />
namic&quot; (as opposed to &quot;static&quot;) HTML <br />
programming languages developed in <br />
the late 1990s. The term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; <br />
gives expression to the apparent fact <br />
that these technological innovations <br />
have spurred changes in the ways in <br />
which the World Wide Web is used and <br />
perceived (cf. Alby 2006: 1-19). Char-<br />
acteristically, Web 2.0 is about interac-<br />
tive and collaborative structures that <br />
enable users to create &quot;user-generated <br />
content&quot;. In Web 2.0, users need not <br />
be mere recipients of media content <br />
but can actively take part in its produc-<br />
tion through activities like blogging, <br />
uploading photos and videos, etc. The <br />
essential technical prerequisite for <br />
these activities is &quot;social software,&quot; or <br />
applications that enable communica-<br />
tion, interaction, and collaboration <br />
through the internet (cf. Steg-<br />
bauer/Jäckel 2008). The distinctive <br />
features of these applications include <br />
the enabling of user-generated content, <br />
the creation of elaborate platforms for <br />
interaction and networking, and user-<br />
friendliness. The central function of <br />
these applications is to get end-users <br />
involved collaboratively in the con-<br />
struction of an internet site and the <br />
generation of its content. In this way, <br />
individual knowledge becomes shared <br />
information. For a comprehensive <br />
overview of Web 2.0 see Alby (2006) <br />
and O’Reilly (2005). <br />
In sum, the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; serves to <br />
vaguely signify the fact that new op-<br />
tions and forms of internet-use have <br />
changed and continue to change what <br />
the World Wide Web is, does, and <br />
means. Whether it will turn out to be <br />
just another marketing buzzword or a <br />
real revolution is another issue. <br />
What is absolutely clear: Web 2.0 <br />
structures are being used commer-<br />
cially. Corporations are engaging in <br />
forms of &quot;open innovation&quot; (cf. Hippel <br />
2005; Chesbrough/Vanhaverbeke/ <br />
West 2007; Drossou/Krempl/Polter-<br />
mann 2006, Chesbrough 2006, 2007), <br />
in which they attempt to integrate <br />
internet users into specific internal <br />
production processes. Examples range <br />
from small Web 2.0 firms, whose en-<br />
tire capital consists of user-generated <br />
content, to the sporadic employment of <br />
Web 2.0 elements by established firms. <br />
Common to the many, heterogeneous <br />
examples of commercial Web 2.0 activ-<br />
ity is that they represent attempts by a <br />
firm to animate internet users to con-<br />
tribute directly or indirectly to the <br />
process of value creation under its con-<br />
trol. This is most starkly manifest in <br />
the phenomenon of crowdsourcing as <br />
defined here. Crowdsourcing is the <br />
clearest example of how firms can mo-<br />
bilize internet users to make a direct <br />
contribution to its processes of value <br />
creation.  <br />
3.3 Types of Crowdsourcing <br />
Crowdsourcing applications are cur-<br />
rently in a phase of experiment and <br />
innovation. Different types of crowd-<br />
sourcing are in use, and it is currently <br />
difficult to predict which, if any, of <br />
these types will become dominant in <br />
the future. Start-ups based solely on <br />
crowdsourcing principles are often just <br />
trial balloons that later can turn out to <br />
be pure hype. However, the empirical <br />
phenomena of crowdsourcing can be <br />
organized typologically, as illustrated <br />
below. <br />
Participation of consumers in product <br />
development and configuration  <br />
Calls by established firms for participa-<br />
tion in the design or configuration of <br />
new products represent one of the <br />
most prevalent forms of crowdsourcing <br />
being used currently. These vary in <br />
intensity from simple opinion polls to <br />
elaborate schemes for the collaborative <br />
development of actual products by <br />
users. One example of product devel-<br />
opment in collaboration with consum-<br />
ers is the call announced by the auto <br />
manufacturer Fiat for its new Fiat 500. <br />
In just a few months, the call generated <br />

ten million clicks, 170,000 designs <br />
from (potential) consumers, and <br />
20,000 specific comments on things <br />
like particular exhaust pipe forms, <br />
chrome bumpers, or Italian flags under <br />
the rear view mirror. Additionally, <br />
consumers created a mascot and al-<br />
most 1,000 accessories. The campaign <br />
was also a complete success from a <br />
marketing point of view. Of course, <br />
participating consumers were not <br />
compensated for their contributions. <br />
Their only wages were feeling their <br />
opinion mattered, the opportunity to <br />
apply their creativity, and the chance <br />
that their design ideas might be real-<br />
ized in the final design of the car. <br />

and it is often initiated by young start-<br />
up companies whose business plans <br />
are based entirely on the crowdsourced <br />
product. Many of these start-ups are <br />
successful, in part because of the ready <br />
availability of good online tools for <br />
managing user input, and in part be-<br />
cause a significant number of hard core <br />
internet users are aesthetes with an <br />
affinity for good design. Thus, it is not <br />
surprising that offerings like that of <br />
spreadshirt.net are well received. On <br />
this site, consumers can upload and <br />
manipulate text, graphics, and photos <br />
for creating individual t-shirt designs. <br />
Customers become designers this way <br />
and can then offer their final designs <br />
for sale in the Spreadshirt &quot;market- related example is Dell&#039;s &quot;Idea <br />
torm&quot; (see Chart 1.). This is a call for <br />
omments and suggestions regarding <br />
he company&#039;s entire product palette, <br />
ot just one single product. <br />

n their input. This kind of call goes <br />
ell beyond the designing, configuring, <br />
nd marketing of products that a firm <br />
lready offers or could offer on its own, <br />
place&quot;. Each designer is given their <br />
own on-line shop and can determine <br />
their prices within a given range. <br />
Spreadshirt handles t-shirt printing <br />
and delivery. <br />
If a shirt is sold with a crowdsourced <br />
design, a portion of the proceeds goes <br />
to the designer. There are now thou-<br />
sands of t-shirt designs available and <br />
the company has been so successful <br />
that it was able to take over a French <br />
competitor, lafraise.com.  <br />

The example of Spreadshirt should be <br />
differentiated from a similar kind of <br />
internet platforming, discussed below <br />
as &quot;market creation&quot;, that is only pe-<br />
ripherally related to crowdsourcing as <br />
defined here. What Spreadshirt does is <br />
crowdsourcing rather than market <br />
creation, because it does not limit itself <br />
to matching t-shirt designers and buy-<br />
ers; it also sells its own designs and <br />
undertakes production and shipping of <br />
every shirt itself. Thus, Spreadshirt is <br />
really a t-shirt print-on-demand busi-<br />
ness that has outsourced a large share <br />
of product design to internet users via <br />
crowdsourcing but still does produc-<br />
tion and marketing in-house. <br />

Competitive bids on specifically de-<br />
fined tasks or problems <br />
Another form of crowdsourcing that <br />
involves activating individual contribu-<br />
tions from a large number of internet <br />
users is the public request for bids on <br />
specifically defined tasks or problems. <br />
Respondents are compensated finan-<br />
cially upon completion of the task or <br />
resolution of the problem. A prominent <br />
example is Proctor &amp; Gamble&#039;s inno-<br />
centive.com (see Chart 2.), a platform <br />
intended to enable the company to tap <br />

 <br />
All those who work on a problem un-<br />
successfully receive no compensation. <br />
Moviebakery1, which uses this form of <br />
crowdsourcing also, is an internet-<br />
based agency that mobilizes amateur <br />
film directors and producers to accept <br />
commissions for internet advertising. <br />
Companies who want an ad turn to the <br />
site&#039;s owners, who post a call for sub-<br />
missions that fit the needs and wishes <br />
of the commissioning company. Per-<br />
sons can respond by sending in their <br />
videos. Moviebakery selects the ten <br />
&quot;best&quot; and pays at least €500 for each <br />
film. The commissioning company <br />
pays Moviebakery €10,000 and re-<br />
ceives all ten videos plus distribution <br />
and promotion in the WWW by <br />
Moviebakery. <br />
Permanent open calls <br />
Another form of crowdsourcing that <br />
works on the principle of the finan-<br />
cially remunerated bid request, but is <br />
not directed toward particular tasks or <br />
problems, is the permanent open call <br />
for the submission of information or <br />
documentation. The best known ex-<br />
ample of this practice is probably the <br />
use of &quot;amateur reporters,&quot; who sub-<br />
mit photos or short articles for publica-<br />
tion or broadcast. CNN engages in this <br />
practice and allows its amateur report-<br />
ers to send in material via cell phone.2 <br />
CNN offers no compensation for vol-<br />
untarily submitted material. In con-<br />
trast, Germany&#039;s BILD newspaper of-<br />
fers its &quot;reader-reporters&quot; €500 for <br />
every nationally published and €100 <br />
for every regionally published photo. <br />
Community reporting <br />
Another way to transform informa-<br />
tional inputs from a large number of <br />
internet users into a marketable prod-<br />
uct is to organize consumers into a <br />
&quot;community&quot; of registered users who <br />
report on new products, new trends or <br />
other kinds of news outsiders might be <br />
willing to pay for.  <br />
                                                             <br />

ireports/toolkit/index.html. <br />
This is the strategy of trendwatch-<br />
ing.com. It brings together over 8,000 <br />
&quot;trend spotters&quot; worldwide. These in-<br />
dividuals are asked to notify the com-<br />
pany regarding any observable changes <br />
in market supply or consumer de-<br />
mand; some even write reports or arti-<br />
cles. This service complements tradi-<br />
tional market research, which always <br />
has had difficulties getting timely in-<br />
formation on the latest trends and <br />
market developments. For their con-<br />
tributions, trend spotters receive <br />
points that can be traded for incentives <br />
of modest value such as iPods or mem-<br />
ory sticks. Trendwatching.com pub-<br />
lishes a yearly trend report and sells <br />
current information to firms and cus-<br />
tomers who want to know what&#039;s &quot;in&quot;. <br />
Product rating by consumers and con-<br />
sumer profiling <br />
Widely used in e-commerce is the <br />
practice of activating and publishing <br />
consumers&#039; knowledge and opinions <br />
about products. Also common is the <br />
collection and utilization of data on the <br />
purchasing habits of its customers. The <br />
prototypical example for both activities <br />
is Amazon.com (http://www.amazon. <br />
com). One of Amazon&#039;s advantages lies <br />
in the fact that many customers submit <br />
unpaid reviews of products it sells. The <br />
information thus gained, however sub-<br />
jective it might be, is relevant for other <br />
customers as they make their own pur-<br />
chasing decisions. Amazon also entices <br />
its customers with additional informa-<br />
tion framed as &quot;customers who bought <br />
the product you just bought also <br />
bought products X, Y, and Z&quot;. This <br />
information is generated through an <br />
analysis of the consumption profiles of <br />
all Amazon users. <br />
Customer-to-customer support <br />
Another kind of crowdsourcing prac-<br />
tice is the organization of customer-to-<br />
customer support via chats and discus-<br />
sion forums. A distinction must be <br />
made between commercial and non-<br />
commercial forms. Non-commercial <br />
forms are discussed in the next section. <br />
Commercial sites are run by companies <br />
for the purpose of customer develop-<br />
 <br />

ment, allowing customers (or pa-<br />
tients), to share their experiences with <br />
others facing similar challenges and <br />
problems. Experiences can be shared, <br />
users can challenge each other to com-<br />
petitions or grant emotional support. <br />
Companies thus enable and encourage <br />
a form of social support much like the <br />
traditional self-help group, but one <br />
that is closely aligned to the company <br />
and its products. On some health sites, <br />
for example, users can compare their <br />
physical fitness levels with others and <br />
thereby derive a competitive kick for <br />
their own exercise regimens. On Nike&#039;s <br />
platform,3 for example, users can up-<br />
load their running times via their iPods <br />
and then use this data to engage in <br />
various competitions with other users. <br />
Another example is the Coop-Online <br />
Coach4 in Switzerland, a site on which <br />
users trade information on healthy <br />
eating and exercise. <br />
3.4 Phenomena Related to <br />
Crowdsourcing <br />
There are many forms of interactive <br />
participation in production processes <br />
currently taking place in the internet <br />
that are similar to crowdsourcing but <br />
should not be conflated with it. Some <br />
of these are conducted by commercial <br />
firms, some by non-commercial project <br />
groups or forums. <br />
Mass customization <br />
Mass customization is an oxymoron <br />
composed of the terms &quot;mass produc-<br />
tion&quot; and &quot;customization&quot;. It refers to a <br />
concept of production that attempts to <br />
capture the advantages of economies of <br />
scale while still taking each individual <br />
customer&#039;s preferences into account <br />
(cf. Pine 1993; Piller 2001; Piller/ <br />
Stotko 2003; Hanisch 2006). The tar-<br />
get is the mass market, but the product <br />
is designed in way that a small number <br />
of its features are variable and can thus <br />
be &quot;personalized&quot;. Mass customization <br />
was made possible only by the advent <br />
                                                             <br />

4 See: https://www.coopcoach.ch/coop-<br />
diaet/. <br />
of modern computer and communica-<br />
tions technology. With the help of an <br />
on-line software application, custom-<br />
ers can configure their product by <br />
themselves. A prototypical example is <br />
the online-shop of the computer seller <br />
Dell. The company offers a few precon-<br />
figured computer models with compo-<br />
nents that can or must be altered in the <br />
course of the customer&#039;s ordering <br />
process. The result is that each cus-<br />
tomer creates her or his &quot;own&quot; com-<br />
puter. The company assumes implicitly <br />
that consumers have a command of the <br />
requisite knowledge about computer <br />
components and their functions. Mass <br />
customization involves the organiza-<br />
tion of a purchase such that specific <br />
design tasks are outsourced to the pur-<br />
chasing individual for a product that <br />
then becomes the property of that per-<br />
son. This differs from crowdsourcing, <br />
which is addressed to an unspecified <br />
quantity of consumers who do not be-<br />
come owners of the finished products.  <br />
Creation of limited access markets <br />
One of the most important forms of <br />
user interaction on the internet takes <br />
place in the form of market transac-<br />
tions organized by a third party. The <br />
third party, whether it be a commercial <br />
or a non-profit enterprise, uses the <br />
internet to activate a latent market. <br />
Platforms that connect sellers and buy-<br />
ers, taking on a purely mediating roll <br />
but deriving financial remuneration for <br />
this activity, are related to the phe-<br />
nomena of interactive value creation <br />
and of consumer work. The product or <br />
service offered on the platform does <br />
not come from the company running <br />
the platform but derives rather from its <br />
users. This is crowdsourcing in the <br />
widest possible connotation since the <br />
success of the site&#039;s owner depends on <br />
how many individuals the company <br />
can animate to proffer their goods or <br />
services to potential sellers. Yet, this <br />
activity is not crowdsourcing by the <br />
definition offered in this paper because <br />
the organization of interaction by a <br />
third party (the company) represents <br />
the entirety of what the company does; <br />
the company produces nothing in the <br />
 <br />

 <br />
traditional sense and thus does not <br />
outsource mere parts of the production <br />
process. This is no longer co-<br />
production.  <br />
One form of market-creating activity is <br />
the creation of limited access markets. <br />
This occurs when firms secure the right <br />
to charge for entry. This often works <br />
much like real-space farmers&#039; or flea <br />
markets: those who desire to sell their <br />
goods must pay market organizers for <br />
the right of access to a potential pool of <br />
buyers. In the internet economy, this is <br />
prototypically organized as a percent-<br />
age commission on the value of goods <br />
and services actually sold. Examples <br />
include eBay, Amazon&#039;s &quot;Marketplace&quot; <br />
and Rent a Coder. Amazon&#039;s &quot;Me-<br />
chanical Turk&quot; is one example where <br />
buyers, not sellers, pay for entry. <br />

The internet auction house eBay <br />
(http://www.ebay.com) and Amazon. <br />
com5 run platforms that allow sellers <br />
and buyers to exchange information, <br />
enable different modes of payment, <br />
and establish a legal framework for the <br />
resulting transactions. The companies <br />
charge a fixed amount or a percentage <br />
of the transaction amount as a com-<br />
                                                             <br />

mission for their services. Only sellers <br />
and buyers are actually active on the <br />
site. The cost of the goods offered is <br />
determined either by the sellers alone <br />
or through the use of a time-delimited <br />
auction. <br />
A newer but expanding field of limited <br />
access market creation involves online <br />
markets for tasks and jobs. This prac-<br />
tice is similar to the form of crowd-<br />
sourcing described above as &quot;competi-<br />
tive bids on specifically defined tasks <br />
or problems&quot; because an entity (usu-<br />
ally a firm) addresses itself in the vir-<br />
tual marketplace via a bid request to a <br />
large group of individuals potentially <br />
interested in performing a specific task <br />
or job. But this practice should be dif-<br />
ferentiated from crowdsourcing, be-<br />
cause the contracting parties do not <br />
interact directly with the company, <br />
although the hosting firm does skim off <br />
a commission. Users do business with <br />
each other, regulated by a conventional <br />
contract. Probably the most popular <br />
example of this kind of activity is the <br />
&quot;Mechanical Turk&quot; (see chart 3.) from <br />
Amazon.com, which was created to <br />
help firms outsource &quot;HITs“ (&quot;Human <br />
Intelligence Tasks“). The concept un-<br />
derlying the “Mechanical Turk” is sim-<br />
ple. It is assumed that humans can <br />
accomplish a wide variety of simple <br />
tasks (HITs), such as the identification <br />

Chart 4 (Source: http://www.rentacoder.com, last view: 03.01.2008) <br />
of certain attributes of photographs, <br />
much better than computers. People <br />
who have too much free time can do <br />
the tasks and earn money in the proc-<br />
ess. The remuneration for each job is <br />
clearly indicated in the task descrip-<br />
tion. A user can, for example, tran-<br />
scribe a four-minute interview for <br />
€0.83 or post articles on low traffic <br />
homepages for €0.02 per posting. In <br />
the case of Mechanical Turk, the buyer <br />
of services, not the seller, must pay for <br />
access to the market. These so called <br />
microjobs are carried out by individu-<br />
als who get paid absolutely rock bot-<br />
tom rates. The sheer pleasure of activ-<br />
ity of any kind, of being productive in <br />
a<br />
vation driving individuals to accept the <br />
jobs. Yet, some observers have ex-<br />
pressed reservations about this phe-<br />
nomenon, one reason being that Ama-<br />
zon&#039;s Mechanical Turk provides a <br />
means by which computers can be pro-<br />
grammed to automatically integrate <br />
the work of humans directly into their <br />
processing. This gives Michael Arring-<br />
ton, founder of the weblog &quot;Tech-<br />
Crunch&quot; the creeps: <br />
&quot;I can’t get the Matrix-we-are-all-<br />
plugged-into-a-machine vision out of <br />
my head. (...) To the [software] appli-<br />
cation [that has been programmed to <br />
use Mechanical Turk], the transaction <br />
looks very much like any remote pro-<br />
cedure call – the application sends the <br />
request, and the service returns the <br />
results. In reality, a network of humans <br />
fuels this Artificial Intelligence by com-<br />
ing to the web site, searching for and <br />
completing tasks, and receiving pay-<br />
ment for their work.&quot;6<br />
Another example of limited market <br />
creation is Rent a Coder (see chart 4.), <br />
which has created a marketplace for <br />
software coders and buyers. Over <br />
180,000 registered programmers re-<br />
spond to bid requests for coding pro-<br />
jects posted by firms or individuals <br />
using the platform. Most of the 2000+ <br />
bid requests open at any one time look <br />
like this. <br />
Creation of free access markets <br />
Another form of market-creating activ-<br />
eation of free access <br />
markets. In these cases, companies <br />
activate markets but charge nothing <br />
for entry. Access to these markets is <br />
open and free of charge to &quot;sellers&quot; and <br />
&quot;buyers&quot;. Sometimes market partici-<br />
pants culminate their activity in an <br />
economic transaction, but more com-<br />
mon is the exchange of goods and ser-<br />
vices – such as information or advice – <br />
free of charge. Site owners may be <br />
commercial enterprises but they get <br />
only derivative income from their sites, <br />
prototypically through advertising. <br />
Examples include flickr, YouTube, Ezi-<br />
neArticles, and thousands of non-<br />

 <br />
commercial information exchange <br />
platforms. <br />
Internet platforms onto which users <br />
upload self-made content – such as <br />
films, videos, digital photos, anima-<br />
tions, and presentations – represent <br />
perhaps the most popular type of free <br />
access market. The most widely used <br />
examples by far are the photo commu-<br />
nity flickr7 and the video community <br />
YouTube8. Each has numerous less <br />
successful competitors. On these sites, <br />
registered users can upload their pho-<br />
tos or videos in unlimited quantity, <br />
virtually free from censoring. This con-<br />
tent is catalogued in a searchable data-<br />
base, enabling millions of other users <br />
to find and link to them. Although us-<br />
ers&#039; activity on these sites is generally <br />
not commercially motivated, and nei-<br />
ther members nor users are charged <br />
anything, these sites are owned and <br />
maintained by firms that are most cer-<br />
tainly interested in making money. <br />
They do so through advertising, which <br />
is only possible because of the content <br />
generated by the participating com-<br />
munity. Due to the enormous amount <br />
of content these sites offer, they are <br />
extremely frequently used, leading to <br />
significant advertising revenues. That <br />
YouTube was bought by the search <br />
engine company Google for $1.65 bil-<br />
lion in stock shows just how much such <br />
companies are worth on the current <br />
market. <br />
An additional example is EzineArti-<br />
cles.com (http://ezinearticles.com). <br />
This company accepts articles from <br />
amateur authors, catalogues them in a <br />
searchable database, and offers them <br />
to publishers of online magazines free <br />
of charge. Neither authors nor editors <br />
pay for the service; it is a pure &quot;match-<br />
ing service&quot; that now has thousands of <br />
pages of current content for distribu-<br />
tion. <br />
The thousands of non-commercial in-<br />
formation exchange platforms existing <br />
                                                             <br />

8 See: http://www.youtube.com. <br />
today are further examples of free ac-<br />
cess market creation, although supply <br />
and demand revolve around informa-<br />
tion that is given for the asking. These <br />
include various forms of internet-chat <br />
platforms (with Web 2.0 these now <br />
encompass other formats such as <br />
wikis, blogs, and homepages) that en-<br />
able the sharing of advice and other <br />
information on a wide variety of spe-<br />
cialized topics. These are peer-to-peer <br />
information exchanges, all sustained <br />
by the ideal of a non-hierarchical <br />
internet community and the norms of <br />
open source and open content projects, <br />
as discussed below.  <br />
On a myriad of platforms, users solve <br />
problems for other users and thus <br />
work very much like a self-help group. <br />
Forums exist, for example, in which <br />
MS Word users describe their prob-<br />
lems with the software and suggest or <br />
ask for problem solutions. On other <br />
forums, users relate their experiences <br />
with their cars; potential buyers of the <br />
same model can gather a wealth of <br />
first-hand information before buying. <br />
Members of vacation communities <br />
exchange tips on where to find the best <br />
beaches, members of cooking commu-<br />
nities exchange recipes. On other plat-<br />
forms, users exchange information on <br />
home remedies for all kinds of ail-<br />
ments. <br />
Open source and open content projects <br />
Crowdsourcing is not the only work-<br />
like process by which users of the <br />
World Wide Web create products and <br />
services. Collaborative activities in the <br />
context of the open source and open <br />
content movement emerged earlier, <br />
and it may even be the case that these <br />
models inspired crowdsourcing. Open <br />
source projects like the operating sys-<br />
tem Linux and open content projects <br />
like the internet encyclopaedia <br />
Wikipedia had a decidedly anti-<br />
commercial impetus. When a user <br />
writes an article in Wikipedia, value <br />
creation in the economic sense does <br />
not occur because the product to which <br />
the user contributes is not exploited <br />
commercially. In contrast, when a firm <br />

takes up an idea submitted by a user, <br />
that user makes a contribution to the <br />
firm&#039;s value creation process. Until <br />
now, the development of ideas always <br />
had been an internal task realized by <br />
regular employees. <br />
In the context of open source and open <br />
content, peer-to-peer interaction is <br />
elemental. All participants are equal <br />
partners, and preventing the emer-<br />
gence of hierarchies is an important <br />
common goal. Since volunteers do all <br />
the necessary work with (usually) no <br />
corporation, and no paid employees <br />
behind the scenes, open source pro-<br />
jects are not a form of crowdsourcing <br />
as defined here. <br />
The products of open source and open <br />
content work are free for all to use. <br />
Individuals who work on a project are <br />
not compensated materially. Their only <br />
profit is recognition, reputation, or <br />
pleasure in doing things for others. <br />
The bestknown example of open con-<br />
tent work is probably the online ency-<br />
clopaedia Wikipedia, which need not <br />
be discussed here. It is worth noting, <br />
however, that Wikipedia is considered <br />
to be the precursor and inspiration for <br />
open content projects in Web 2.0. A <br />
large number of more specialized but <br />
similar wiki-projects have been <br />
launched. A continually updated list of <br />
these can be found – where else but? – <br />
on a wiki platform.9  <br />
A related and interesting field of activ-<br />
ity is open-content journalism. There <br />
are many &quot;citizen journalism&quot; or &quot;grass <br />
roots&quot; news homepages, the content of <br />
which is created independently by us-<br />
ers. Examples like indymedia.org or <br />
zero.newsassignment.net show that the <br />
idea can work. However, unlike <br />
Wikipedia, the journalistic quality of <br />
these sites has yet to be evaluated. The <br />
owners and users of these sites con-<br />
sider themselves independent journal-<br />
ists working in opposition to main <br />
stream reporting and adhere to open <br />

4 Factors Contributing to <br />
the Increasing Prevalence <br />
of Crowdsourcing <br />
Crowdsourcing is part of a broad and <br />
historically significant trend, by which <br />
the capitalist firm is targeting consum-<br />
ers for integration into the process of <br />
value creation more than ever before, <br />
and in completely new ways, such as <br />
those now possible via the World Wide <br />
Web. Of interest from the perspective <br />
of the sociology and psychology of <br />
work is understanding why and how <br />
consumers are being systematically <br />
exploited as a &quot;second type&quot; of worker; <br />
i.e., as workers who receive no finan-<br />
cial compensation or who are compen-<br />
sated at a level that is in gross dispro-<br />
portion to the value the company ex-<br />
tracts from their input. This analysis <br />
can also be applied to areas beyond the <br />
internet economy. <br />
Crowdsourcing represents the most <br />
explicit form of the integration of users <br />
(or consumers) in internal processes of <br />
value creation; it enables the direct <br />
utilization of consumer work for com-<br />
mercial purposes. The charging of <br />
commissions for the use of limited <br />
access markets represents another type <br />
of direct utilization that is possible <br />
within the context of the internet <br />
economy. Further instances of com-<br />
mercial utilization are indirect and <br />
include the use of Web 2.0 sites for <br />
advertising purposes or the cost-<br />
cutting transformation of customer <br />

 <br />
service to customer self-service as in <br />
the case of internet banking. <br />
Three important questions regarding <br />
crowdsourcing remain largely unan-<br />
swered. What are the typical methods <br />
employed by crowdsourcing firms to <br />
mobilize and utilize the work of users <br />
and consumers? What motivates com-<br />
panies to crowdsource? What moti-<br />
vates users and consumers to respond <br />
and participate? The following theo-<br />
retical reflections on these questions <br />
serve as a preliminary basis for future <br />
empirical study.  <br />
4.1 Firms Initiating Crowdsourc-<br />
ing <br />
One of the most basic motivations for <br />
companies to establish an internet <br />
presence is the possibility of realizing <br />
cost reductions by expanding areas of <br />
self-service via the web. Costs are re-<br />
duced when internal work processes <br />
can be transferred to the consumer <br />
(&quot;outsourcing to the customer&quot;).  <br />
More important and more innovative <br />
are company activities meant to in-<br />
clude users as active partners in the <br />
value creation process, making a direct <br />
contribution to company profits. This <br />
involves contributing to product inno-<br />
vation (the consumer as &quot;co-<br />
designer&quot;), contributing to product <br />
improvement (the user as &quot;beta <br />
tester&quot;), evaluating customer service <br />
(often the evaluation of individual ser-<br />
vice representatives or private sellers), <br />
or participating in the configuration of <br />
a product or its production.  <br />
Technological improvements (includ-<br />
ing not just the internet but new vend-<br />
ing machines for all kinds of products <br />
and services) make it easy and inex-<br />
pensive to integrate consumers into <br />
work processes. A company successful <br />
in doing so can reap a variety of bene-<br />
fits (Grün/Brunner 2002): <br />
1. Cost reduction through reducing <br />
complexity. For example, the introduc-<br />
tion of standardized internet portals <br />
reduces the complexity of interaction <br />
with consumers because portals re-<br />
strict the variety of user transactions. <br />
2. Productivity gains through more <br />
efficient use of resources. For example, <br />
companies can expand geographically <br />
and increase daily service hours with-<br />
out increasing expenses by using <br />
automated, self-service solutions.  <br />
3. Increase of turnover. Products can <br />
be offered at lower prices and more <br />
flexibly in terms of service hours and <br />
geographic distribution, resulting in an <br />
expansion of the customer base. <br />
4. Quality improvement using con-<br />
sumer knowledge. In the context of <br />
integrating customers into productive <br />
processes, companies can make use of <br />
customers&#039; expertise – in the use of <br />
company products, for example. In this <br />
way, customers can contribute to the <br />
betterment of product quality. <br />
The first three advantages involve the <br />
outsourcing of work to customers us-<br />
ing forms of self-service. The fourth <br />
kind of advantage arises through the <br />
integration of users as partners in the <br />
value creation process; it takes on <br />
other specific forms as well, such as the <br />
mobilization of consumers to develop <br />
product innovations. <br />
Reichwald and Piller (2006: 149-154) <br />
name four additional benefits for firms <br />
arising from the mobilization of con-<br />
sumers in the value creation process. <br />
These are the reduction of the time it <br />
takes to develop new products (&quot;time-<br />
to-market&quot;), the reduction of the costs <br />
of innovation (&quot;cost-to-market&quot;), the <br />
increase of market acceptance of new <br />
products and consumers&#039; willingness <br />
to buy them (&quot;fit-to-market&quot;), and the <br />
increase of consumers&#039; subjective per-<br />
ception of the actual newness of a new <br />
product (&quot;new-to-market&quot;). <br />
Firms often closely emulate the aes-<br />
thetics and rhetoric of the open source <br />
and open content culture in order to <br />
motivate users to participate in crowd-<br />
sourcing projects. These campaigns <br />
orient themselves to images of self-<br />
determination, community orientation, <br />
and creativity. These correspond well <br />
to the areas in which crowdsourcing is <br />
most often employed: product configu-<br />
 <br />

ration and design, problem solution, <br />
and innovation. All these activities <br />
challenge individuals&#039; creative capaci-<br />
ties and are more likely to be subjec-<br />
tively satisfying to the participant. Yet, <br />
quite contrary to open source and open <br />
content culture is the practice, associ-<br />
ated with some forms of crowdsourc-<br />
ing, of offering financial remuneration <br />
to those who produce the &quot;right&quot; or the <br />
&quot;best&quot; response to a bid request. <br />
The orientation to open source and <br />
open content culture is probably <br />
strongest among crowdsourcing pro-<br />
jects that target the internet&#039;s heavy <br />
users. Similarly, companies that sell <br />
purely crowdsourced products are <br />
likely to be oriented toward this culture <br />
strongly, especially if they were <br />
launched by private individuals who <br />
developed their business concept as a <br />
result of their experiences on the <br />
internet.  <br />
4.2 Respondents to Crowdsourc-<br />
ing Initiatives <br />
The first and foremost question re-<br />
garding individuals who respond to <br />
crowdsourcing initiatives is: Why do <br />
they do it? A theoretically oriented <br />
answer differentiates between extrinsic <br />
and intrinsic motivations. An extrinsi-<br />
cally motivated person performs an <br />
activity in order to obtain some kind of <br />
external reward. Rewards for working <br />
consumers could be benefits for one&#039;s <br />
career, recognition for work done, or <br />
the satisfaction of pursuing common <br />
goals. An intrinsically motivated per-<br />
son, on the other hand, takes up an <br />
activity for its own sake – or for fun&#039;s <br />
sake (Ryan/Deci 2000). <br />
It would be especially interesting to <br />
know which factors make activities <br />
worth doing for their own sake, making <br />
them intrinsically motivating. Some <br />
potential answers are offered by the <br />
theory of self-determination (Ryan/ <br />
Deci 2000), according to which hu-<br />
mans are drawn to activities that allow <br />
them to experience personal adept-<br />
ness, autonomy, and social embedded-<br />
ness. Thus, someone who is a talented <br />
skier can decide when and where to <br />
ski, and can do it together with others. <br />
Her or he is intrinsically motivated and <br />
will ski even in the absence of external <br />
rewards. Following this pattern, Ryan <br />
and Deci (2000) identify clearly intrin-<br />
sic and extrinsic motivations as well as <br />
mixed forms. Similar considerations <br />
on intrinsic motivation emerge from <br />
the job characteristics model (JCM) <br />
used in work psychology (Hack-<br />
man/Oldham 1980). The model ad-<br />
dresses itself to varieties of job tasks <br />
and identifies particular characteristics <br />
that would appear to increase the in-<br />
trinsic motivation of workers. These <br />
are similar to characteristics that ap-<br />
pear in other models of humane work <br />
such as worker autonomy and the abil-<br />
ity to work in a holistic manner. <br />
Among the studies of motivations un-<br />
derlying the special phenomenon of <br />
consumer work, a portion focuses on <br />
open source and open content projects. <br />
Another portion focuses on commer-<br />
cial enterprises. <br />
Empirical studies of open source and <br />
open content projects strongly suggest <br />
that even when contributions are un-<br />
paid, extrinsic motivators are never-<br />
theless often present. These include <br />
career related benefits (Robles et al. <br />
2001) and the desire to acquire new <br />
knowledge, to share expertise with <br />
others, and to reach common goals <br />
(Gosh et al. 2002). Yet intrinsic moti-<br />
vation (&quot;fun&quot;) appears to be the decid-<br />
ing reason for getting involved (Luthi-<br />
ger Stoll 2006). Inquiring into the ori-<br />
gin of intrinsic motivations, a study by <br />
Lakhani and Wolf (2005) suggests that <br />
the experience of being creative is most <br />
closely linked to readiness to work on <br />
open source projects. In a very instruc-<br />
tive study that used the Job Character-<br />
istics Model, Schroer and Hertel <br />
(2007) surveyed task characteristics <br />
associated with persons who work on <br />
the internet encyclopaedia Wikipedia. <br />
In their findings, readiness to partici-<br />
pate was most closely associated with <br />
autonomy, task significance, and the <br />
newness of the challenge or &quot;skill vari-<br />
ety&quot;. Whether or not these task charac-<br />
teristics actually lead to participation <br />
 <br />

                                                <div class="plaintext">22 STI Studies 2008: 5-26 <br />
 <br />
depended on the presence of intrinsic <br />
motivations. In other words, intrinsic <br />
motivations function as one mediator <br />
between task characteristics and par-<br />
ticipation. Contrary to expectations, <br />
strongly participating individuals re-<br />
ported an unfavourable personal cost-<br />
benefit balance. All indications are that <br />
participants are aware of the imbal-<br />
ance but possess an immanent willing-<br />
ness to participate anyway.  <br />
Keep in mind that participation in <br />
open source and open content projects <br />
serves community-set goals that are of <br />
great significance for collaborators. <br />
The situation is very different when <br />
working consumers collaborate with <br />
commercial enterprises. Why some <br />
consumers willingly do so was investi-<br />
gated by Bateson (1985), in an early <br />
study of a variety of different services. <br />
The study employed both qualitative <br />
and quantitative methods. The results <br />
indicated that consumers are willing to <br />
do more work themselves because they <br />
hope that by doing so they can save <br />
money and better control the service <br />
they receive (cf. Michel 1997, 2000; <br />
Voswinkel 2000). Reichwald and Piller <br />
(2006) found that besides the above <br />
mentioned intrinsic motivations, con-<br />
sumers who participate in forms of <br />
product innovation are also motivated <br />
by dissatisfaction with existing solu-<br />
tions and the expectation that they can <br />
help make products that are better <br />
attuned to consumer needs. <br />
A number of additional studies focus <br />
specifically on self-service technologies <br />
(Dabholkar 1996; Meuter/Ostrom/ <br />
Bittner 2000; Dabholkar/Bobitt/Lee <br />
2003). Some studies investigated par-<br />
ticular scenarios – for example, a fast <br />
food scenario in which interview sub-<br />
jects were asked to identify the condi-<br />
tions under which they would use self-<br />
service technology without any qualms <br />
(Dabholkar 1996). Other studies were <br />
based on field research involving self-<br />
service technologies already in use, <br />
self-scanning being one example (Dab-<br />
holkar/Bobitt/Lee 2003). Based on <br />
their own and others&#039; research Dab-<br />
holkar, Bobitt, and Lee (2003) come to <br />
the conclusion that the positive recep-<br />
tion of self-service situations depends <br />
on the extent to which individuals an-<br />
ticipate being able to control the proc-<br />
ess. The expectation that using the <br />
technology would be fun also appeared <br />
to motivate customers. Other, less sig-<br />
nificant factors included time-savings, <br />
(low) required effort, (low) complexity, <br />
reliability, precision, and one&#039;s (posi-<br />
tive) attitude toward technology. When <br />
asked about their preferences regard-<br />
ing interaction with employees, cus-<br />
tomers&#039; opinions were split. Some con-<br />
sidered it an advantage, others a dis-<br />
advantage. <br />
In sum, the primary motivations of <br />
working consumers are intrinsic (&quot;for <br />
the fun of it&quot;), but also of central im-<br />
portance are characteristics that make <br />
tasks fun (autonomy, creativity, impor-<br />
tance of the task). Extrinsic motiva-<br />
tions such as the satisfaction of pursu-<br />
ing common goals or timesavings are <br />
also relevant but appear to be less <br />
critical. <br />
The studies reviewed above allow for <br />
an initial assessment of the motiva-<br />
tions of working consumers, but a few <br />
caveats are in order. The studies com-<br />
monly observe quite different motiva-<br />
tions, making them difficult to com-<br />
pare. Many studies employ online <br />
questionnaires with one or, at most, a <br />
very few items for the factors being <br />
investigated. Affirmative answers on <br />
these items do not necessarily add up <br />
to a valid picture of the actual attitudes <br />
that permeate the projects. Compre-<br />
hensive qualitative studies of the eve-<br />
ryday behaviour of working consumers <br />
are needed to achieve this. <br />
5 Conclusions <br />
The essence of crowdsourcing, as de-<br />
fined here, is the intentional mobiliza-<br />
tion for commercial exploitation of <br />
creative ideas and other forms of work <br />
performed by consumers. Other Web <br />
2.0 based activities that do not inte-<br />
grate users into a firm&#039;s value creation <br />
process are related but peripheral to <br />

crowdsourcing. By responding to <br />
crowdsourcing calls, consumers con-<br />
tribute to a commercial firm&#039;s efforts at <br />
product and/or process innovation. <br />
Crowdsourcing represents, first of all, a <br />
quantitative expansion of the older <br />
trend toward integrating consumers in <br />
productive processes, in that it allows <br />
firms to reach a greater number of in-<br />
dividuals. But it is also a good example <br />
of a new form of consumer integration, <br />
whereby persons who have no relations <br />
to the firm are persuaded to do work <br />
for it or its customers. Thus, crowd-<br />
sourcing goes beyond classic co-<br />
production, by which consumers con-<br />
tribute to the production of a good or <br />
service that they personally consume. <br />
The phenomena of crowdsourcing con-<br />
firm the working consumer thesis, de-<br />
tailed at the beginning of this paper: <br />
society is witnessing the emergence of <br />
a new type of consumer, whose work <br />
capacity is being increasingly exploited <br />
(usually with their full complicity) for <br />
commercial purposes. Whereas the <br />
emergence of the working consumer is <br />
independent of specific technologies, <br />
crowdsourcing has come into its own <br />
only with the advent of Web 2.0. <br />
The future consequences of crowd-<br />
sourcing for firms and consumers are a <br />
matter for conjecture. However, the <br />
following three aspects are likely to be <br />
among the most significant develop-<br />
ments. <br />
5.1 Distribution of profits and <br />
other economic conse-<br />
quences <br />
For firms, outsourcing to the consumer <br />
carries a significant potential for in-<br />
creased profits, just as it puts regular <br />
employees at risk. Yet profits are not <br />
guaranteed. The ability of firms to real-<br />
ize economic benefits from crowd-<br />
sourcing is conditioned upon many <br />
variables. Crowdsourcing strategies <br />
and platforms require significant in-<br />
vestments; whether these investments <br />
pay off depends on how the crowd re-<br />
sponds to the crowdsourcing call. Even <br />
the interaction with consumers itself <br />
can be cost intensive, depending on the <br />
level of complexity involved. <br />
Consumers also stand to benefit from <br />
participating in crowdsourcing.  They <br />
may reap a (low) wage. In competitive <br />
situations, winners may be compen-<br />
sated quite well. In other cases, how-<br />
ever, there is no remuneration. <br />
5.2 Influence on product design <br />
Some forms of crowdsourcing are used <br />
by firms to stimulate consumer coop-<br />
eration in terms of product develop-<br />
ment and improvement. In the suc-<br />
cessful cases, firms profit from con-<br />
sumers&#039; expertise and experience. In-<br />
novation provided by consumers can <br />
also be used for marketing purposes, as <br />
seen in the case of the Fiat 500 cam-<br />
paign. Yet when a firm enters the <br />
realm of internet communications, it <br />
exposes itself to new kinds of vulner-<br />
abilities. What happens, for example, <br />
to the firm and its image if customers <br />
and bloggers express disapproval of <br />
the company or its products?  <br />
Crowdsourcing gives consumers a new <br />
avenue of influence on corporate deci-<br />
sion-making, at least indirectly <br />
through means such as recommending <br />
new designs and influencing public <br />
opinion. At the same time, consumers <br />
are themselves exposed to a new dan-<br />
ger: the danger of being exploited by a <br />
corporation as a cheap supplier of <br />
valuable ideas stripped of control over <br />
their use. This dependency is some-<br />
what alleviated when firms are at least <br />
willing to make public which consumer <br />
ideas were actually implemented. Dell <br />
engages in this practice on its &quot;Ideas-<br />
torm&quot; platform. <br />
5.3 Quality of work and working <br />
conditions <br />
An important question for firms is <br />
whether the crowd actually can deliver <br />
quality work. Without question, the <br />
consumer is the real expert in the use <br />
of a firm&#039;s products and services, and <br />
their knowledge and experiences are of <br />
great potential value. Yet, several fac-<br />
tors limit the quality of consumer work <br />
in practice. A central issue is the pro-<br />

fessional qualifications of participants <br />
involved in the productive process. <br />
Regular employees possess requisite <br />
qualifications as a condition of their <br />
employment. Questions and issues <br />
relating to the qualifications of work-<br />
ing consumers are (as yet) unexplored <br />
and unresolved. This means that firms <br />
take a risk in transferring responsibili-<br />
ties to the crowd. For example, virtual <br />
health communities must decide <br />
whether they want to assume the re-<br />
sponsibility for checking the soundness <br />
of medical advice posted by patients <br />
and possibly intervening to stem the <br />
spread of dangerous misinformation. <br />
Another problem is that consumers&#039; <br />
expertise is very specific and relates <br />
only to the corporation&#039;s front stage, to <br />
use Goffman&#039;s (1959) expression. They <br />
know little or nothing about back stage <br />
processes, making them uninitiated in <br />
an essential area of knowledge, which <br />
company employees have at their dis-<br />
posal. This relative disadvantage could <br />
be lessened, of course, with future <br />
changes in the integration of working <br />
consumers. <br />
An important issue from the perspec-<br />
tive of consumers is the quality of the <br />
&quot;working conditions&quot; they face. Ideally, <br />
crowdsourced work or tasks will be <br />
organized to harmonize with their in-<br />
trinsic motivations. Such work is char-<br />
acterized by high worker autonomy, <br />
opportunities for communication with <br />
others, the utilization of worker&#039;s spe-<br />
cial talents, and a linkage to personal <br />
development. Under these conditions <br />
– a best case scenario of crowdsourc-<br />
ing – respondents actually stand to <br />
gain a more satisfying work experience <br />
than in their real job. <br />
There is no way to predict exactly what <br />
the working consumer of the future <br />
will be doing or how the relationship <br />
between consumer work and tradi-<br />
tional employment will be organized. <br />
But the passive customer model is <br />
unlikely to dominate any longer. In <br />
response, future research in the field of <br />
labour studies likely will place a <br />
stronger emphasis on forms of work <br />
that have little to do with &quot;employ-<br />
ment&quot; in the traditional sense. <br />
