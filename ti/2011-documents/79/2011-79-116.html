				<p>In my previous posting <a target="_blank" href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/games/">“Inventing the Future”</a> I covered the upcoming competition created by a combination of Jane McGonigal and the ten year forecast team at the <a href="http://www.iftf.org">Institute for the Future</a> called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.superstructgame.org/">“Superstruct”.</a> They describe it as <em>“the world’s first massively multiplayer forecasting game.”</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>&quot;By playing the game, you'll help us chronicle the world of 2019--and imagine how we might solve the problems we'll face,&quot;</em></p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><em>&quot;Because this is about more than just envisioning the </em><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/"><em>future</em></a><em>. It's about making the </em><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/"><em>future</em></a><em>, inventing new ways to organize the </em><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/"><em>human</em></a><em> race and augment our collective </em><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/"><em>human</em></a><em> potential.&quot;</em> </p> </blockquote>  <p><em></em>As with all Jane’s alternate reality games, this one starts with a scenario. In the case of Superstruct, it begins with the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><b>&quot;Humans have 23 years to go:&#160; </b><i>Global Extinction Awareness System starts the countdown for Homo sapiens.</i> PALO ALTO, CA — Based on the results of a year-long supercomputer simulation, the Global Extinction Awareness System (GEAS) has reset the &quot;survival horizon&quot; for Homo sapiens—the human race—from &quot;indefinite&quot; to 23 years.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>When the game is over, the Ten Year Forecast team at the IftF will will review and analyze all the input received and post a report of the key insights for the year 2019, and the best tactics for inventing and &quot;superstructing” the future.</p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:1236f033-2c02-4830-bd4e-ab0a4b1bdd7b" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div id="003f0d9e-0a83-4b7b-8427-37a71d80a8aa" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44tsI4IzGcg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" target="_new"><img src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451712b69e2010535835246970b-pi" style="border-style: none" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('003f0d9e-0a83-4b7b-8427-37a71d80a8aa'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/44tsI4IzGcg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/44tsI4IzGcg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""></a></div></div></div>  <p>   <br />Well the game is now live (as of Oct. 6, 2008) and will run for about the next six weeks.&#160; There are a number of fun and informative videos on the <a target="_blank" href="&ldquo;Superstruct&rdquo;">Superstruct</a> site such as the one above.&#160; So for those of you who are interested in joining in the fun head on over to the Superstruct site and start predicting the future now!</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jane_McGonigal_at_Foo_Camp_2008.jpg"><img height="267" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/Jane_McGonigal_at_Foo_Camp_2008.jpg/200px-Jane_McGonigal_at_Foo_Camp_2008.jpg" width="200" align="right" border="0" /></a>I've been a big fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGonigal" target="_blank">Jane McGonigal</a> ever since I had the chance to talk with her at the <a href="http://www.learning2007.com" target="_blank">Learning 2007</a> conference where we were both speakers. One of the many reasons I so like her work is her focus on what is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game" target="_blank">“alternate reality gaming” or ARG</a> (gotta have an acronym or it ain’t real right?).&#160; While Jane is a very fun person (who else would carry the title of&#160; &quot;Head PuppetMaster&quot;?), trust me when I say that her work on games and their consequent results has been very “serious” indeed. <em>Harvard Business Review</em> called her theory of &quot;alternate reality business&quot; one of the &quot;Top 20 Breakthrough Ideas of 2008&quot;.&#160; Check out Jane's company <a href="http://www.avantgame.com/" target="_blank">AvantGame</a> and <a href="http://avantgame.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">her blog</a> for more information and I think you too will soon be a big fan.</p>  <p>I’ve been promoting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">augmented reality</a> over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality" target="_blank">virtual reality</a> for a long time, and Jane’s unique approach of adding gaming to the equation is brilliant. I believe that Jane and her games are the best examples that I know of for showing off some of the true power of applying game theory. I especially appreciate the truly unique approach and out-of-the-box thinking she has brought to gaming. Jane’s games are also great examples of a common theme here on OCOT—the power and beauty of simplicity. Unlike most game examples, which typically involve a lot of hardware and software technology and are highly dependent upon the game developers and platforms, Jane's games are an extremely “low tech” model that puts the game players in charge. It all starts with and is based upon a simple opening statement or premise and is then left up to the players to provide all the excitement and direction online, usually with simple tools such as e-mails, blogs, and IM. You can see this for yourself by checking out some of her past successes such as <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Without_Oil">World Without Oil</a></i>, <a href="http://www.cruelgame.com/" target="_blank">Cruel 2 B Kind</a>, and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Bees">I Love Bees</a></i>.</p>  <h3>Superstruct is Super!</h3>  <p>All this is just an introduction though to a new joint venture that I'm intrigued by and which Jane is leading with the <a href="http://www.iftf.org" target="_blank">Institute for the Future</a> called “<a href="http://www.iftf.org/node/2098" target="_blank">Superstruct</a>”. They describe it as “the world’s first massively multiplayer forecasting game. It’s not just about envisioning the future—it’s about inventing the future.”&#160; As with all her alternate reality games, this one starts with a scenario. In the case of Superstruct, it begins with the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><b>&quot;Humans have 23 years to go:&#160; </b><i>Global Extinction Awareness System starts the countdown for Homo sapiens.</i> PALO ALTO, CA — Based on the results of a year-long supercomputer simulation, the Global Extinction Awareness System (GEAS) has reset the &quot;survival horizon&quot; for Homo sapiens—the human race—from &quot;indefinite&quot; to 23 years.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>You can read the rest of the details in the link above and <a href="http://www.iftf.org/node/2096">this Superstruct FAQ</a>.&#160; Highly recommend that you take a few minutes to check out the link to <a href="http://www.iftf.org/node/2098" target="_blank">Superstruct</a> to learn more. Although the game doesn’t officially start until September 2008, they have already started a precursor in the form of comments to the announcement and an initial premise of: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;It’s the summer of 2019. Imagine you’re already there, and tell us a little bit about your future self. Where are you having dinner tonight?&quot; </p> </blockquote>  <p>For more on Superstruct and other AR games check out the <a href="http://www.argn.com/archive/000741_superstruct_rebuilding_our_future.php">ARGNet</a> for more alternative reality games.&#160; While it is obviously still early in the process, I was struck by the degree to which the initial comments seem to see and predict a very negative future, and it's all the more reason for us to all take a role in changing this by envisioning and designing one that is positive. If you believe as I do that WE are ultimately in control of the future, then why would we design and aim for anything less? PLEASE be sure to check out the comments and add some of your own!</p>  <h3>Forget Predicting the Future. Let's Get Busy Designing It!</h3>  <p>What I'm most passionate about, and my reason for alerting you to this new glimpse into the future, is the whole idea of not predicting the future, but &quot;inventing it&quot; as Jane has also been known to say. This of course parallels one of my favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay" target="_blank">Alan Kay</a>' quotes:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>This hands on, get involved, take responsibility and action approach has always spoken to me loudly, and so I’m struck by the increasing number and diversity of ways that this is actually happening and how we collectively can and are creating the future. It sure beats the more typically fatalistic attitudes I seem to run into so often that &quot;they&quot; are causing everything or that technology is somehow in control of our future. I'm desperately hoping and sincerely believe that as these recent examples show, we are seeing the turnaround of the &quot;victim mentality&quot; that seems to have become so prevalent and we are going to seize both the opportunity and the responsibility to make the future one that we want to live in and be a part of.&#160; </p>  <p>Game on!</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zappowbang/386123330/"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="244" alt="cool tools" src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/cool%20tools.jpg" width="164" align="right" border="0"></a> Over the years, many people have asked about some of the "cool tools" I use to do some of the things I do, which range from presentations to podcasts, welding to woodworking, and sailing to speaking.&nbsp; </p> <p>In one such discussion a few months ago, long-time colleague Tom King, who now also works with Elliott Masie and the <a href="http://www.masie.com">Masie Center</a> as a "Masie Fellow", sent me the following note:</p> <blockquote> <p>"I'm fascinated by some of the nifty tools I discover one way or another through contact with you. Things like doodle.ch or SlideShare or however the heck you get transcriptions of your podcasts. A totally separate and intriguing topic is how you quickly create such compelling, lengthy, thoughtful posts, podcasts &amp; presentations. I've already seen quite a preso on "Whole New Mind" from you."</p> <p>"Moving back to nifty tools....I think the interesting idea here is how these tools are discovered and shared-- and what makes them good. That process of discovery &amp; recognition seems to be the long-term value, even if any given "nifty tool" has a place that is only ephemeral in the Internet-time mid-term time phase." </p> <p>And he went on to say:</p> <p>"For what it's worth, I think the best tools develop when the tool will "scratch an itch" for their very own developer... or someone near &amp; dear to them. Likewise, I think the best recommendations for a tool comes from someone who uses it, and the second best source is a recommendation from someone who has a trusted/respected source that uses a tool. If the user is passionate enough to convey the value to that second party (who may not even use such a tool), and then recommends it to me.. well sometimes I find that is actually the best recommendation."</p></blockquote> <p>Couldn't agree more with your observations, Tom !&nbsp; I too find great value in discovering such tools, tips, and tricks from you and others.&nbsp; </p> <p>Tom being Tom, he had already started to post some of his favorite tools, tips, and tricks on his blog <a href="http://mobilemind.net/" target="_blank">Mobilemind</a> (highly recommended BTW), and you can check out his lists of <a href="http://mobilemind.net/2008/01/servicesweb-solutions-i-loved-in-2007.html" target="_blank">favorite Web Solutions</a> and his <a href="http://mobilemind.net/2008/01/applications-i-loved-in-2007.html" target="_blank">favorite applications</a> from earlier this year.</p> <h3>Cool Tools Kevin Uses:</h3> <p>Of course this is not a new idea. Another of my favorite people, Kevin Kelly over at <em>Wired</em> magazine, has has been doing a phenomenal job of covering a similar idea on his site <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/" target="_blank">Cool Tools</a>.&nbsp; His description is right on target for me:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Cool tools really work. A cool tool can be any book, gadget, software, video, map, hardware, material, or web site that is tried and true. All reviews on this site are written by readers who have actually used the tool and others like it. Items can be either old or new as long as they are wonderful. We only post things we like and ignore the rest. Suggestions for tools much better than what is recommended here are always wanted."</p></blockquote> <h3>Even Dads can be Cool!</h3> <p>And then there is the totally cool offshoot that sprang up a bit later by Chris Anderson at <em>Wired</em> magazine called <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/" target="_blank">Geek Dad</a>.&nbsp; Check it out, no matter what your gender or status.&nbsp; </p> <h3>So Many Tools, So Little Time</h3> <p>But what about the rest of us?&nbsp; I truly believe that every one of us (yes, that includes YOU!) has cool tools that we use on an every day basis.&nbsp; Even more valuable are cool stories about how we use these tools and how we came to find and use them.&nbsp; How many of the cool tools that you use did you discover by seeing someone else use them?&nbsp; Many, I suspect, but the problem is that as great as such serendipitous discovery is, it doesn't seem to scale very well. Considering that there are about to be 6.6 billion of us populating this planet, I think we may all have a few more to discover!</p> <p>Later on in my discussion with Tom, I noted that I too am fascinated by the process of discovery, and I often point out that discovery is the opposite of invention—that discovery is the finding of something that already exists—whereas invention is the creation of something that never existed before (though most often consists of new combinations of previously existing ideas or things).&nbsp; My point is to emphasize the differences and the power of going after both. I’m equally intrigued by the differences between invention and innovation, but I’ll stop myself from digressing (lucky you!) yet again. I merely want to emphasize how strongly I agree with Tom's larger point which is the value of the process of discovery and sharing.</p> <p>So, thanks to Tom for the push. I'd like to see what we can do here on OCOT and as a group to explore and discover more Cool Tools. For starters, here are some quick thoughts from me and questions for all of YOU:</p> <ul> <li>Is this a topic that you would find to be of high value?  <li>Would YOU consider contributing one or more of your top cool tools and stories of how you discovered it, use it, etc.?  <li>Would this topic be well served by having a longer term “theme” or space on OCOT that is dedicated to “cool tools I use”? Or would one or two blog posts suffice?  <li>Might we be able to create a template that would help people describe their cool tools and stories, and make it easier for others to discover and use them?&nbsp; <li>Would a wiki-like capability work best for this, so that any given tool or technique could be expanded over time, so that other could add their examples of how they use the same tool differently, provide additional techniques or suggestions for getting more out of them, and add their own stories about how they came to discover the tool?  <li>Might “Cool Tools I Use” be a big enough topic to deserve its own “space” (section of a site, whole blog/wiki itself, etc.)?&nbsp; For example, this could be a really eclectic mix of tools, where we are looking to discover them in any and all applications, walks of life, etc.</li></ul> <p>Please send in your comments or e-mails to let me know your thoughts on these questions.</p> <h3>Serious Fun, so let's make this a game!</h3> <p>In many cases we cease to consciously think about these tools. We use them so frequently and for so long that they are part of our "unconscious competency".&nbsp; To "discover" them again, you may need to start <em>noticing</em> them again.&nbsp; </p> <p>So let's turn this exercise into a version of a once popular game based on the premise "If you could only take 10 things with you to live on a remote island for 10 years (randomly picked numbers), what would those be?"&nbsp; And in the spirit of a game, let's not get too literal with this. Let's imagine that our basic needs for survival are met and focus instead on those things we could otherwise not live without.&nbsp; In most cases, we probably could live without these, we just don't want to!</p> <p>And let's really do some coloring outside the lines with this theme and not restrict ourselves to computers or the net!&nbsp; I could imagine collecting “cool tool” ideas for anything from cooking to car repair to computers or canoeing (today’s post is brought to you by the letter C!).</p> <h3>Let's get Started!</h3> <p>In the interim, I thought I'd get things started by creating a "Cool Tools I Use" theme here on OCOT and use this to collect and share some of the cool tools each of us have found invaluable and to also share, perhaps even more importantly, the ways we found them or how they found us.&nbsp; What I'll do on OCOT to help with this effort is create a metadata tag called "Cool Tools" and make sure all "Cool Tools" entries are marked with this tag so you can find them easily in the future.</p> <p>Oh, and just for clarity, let's be clear that this is NOT to be used for nor does it represent ANY endorsement of promotion of a company or a specific product. These are authentic stories about "Cool Tools" that we use all the time and would not want to be without. </p> <p>Should be fun, and if not, we won't do it!&nbsp; </p> <h3>Now it's YOUR turn!</h3> <p>OK, that should be more than enough to give you an idea of what I'm thinking about.&nbsp; Now it is YOUR turn to think about the "Cool Tools" you use and would never want to be without.&nbsp; Send me your responses to my previous questions and we'll follow through accordingly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, have a "Cool Tool" you use and want to share?&nbsp; Send me your favorites with the following information and I'll start collecting and publishing yours and more of mine.</p> <ul> <li>Name of the tool and source for getting one.  <li>What does it do?  <li>How did you come to discover this?  <li>How do you use it?  <li>Why is it on your top ten "Cool Tools I Use" list?</li></ul> <p>I'm sure EACH of you have a list of tools you would not want to be without, and you probably have tools you know that are much better than the ones I have on my list. I can't wait to start to learning and benefiting from your cool tools!</p> <p><strong><em>w<br>a<br>yne<br>=====</em></strong></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Would you be interested in a future where the pursuit of fun and enjoyment was one our our major roles in life because it leads to solving extraordinarily large and complex world problems? For example, what if all of us helped to digitize all the content contained in all the books in the world? Almost none of this content is currently available on the Web or in any digital form and as such, is largely inaccessible to most. And would you be interested in a world where the relationship between computers and humans is a very positive and symbiotic one? I know I would.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'd like to bring your attention to some of the ways in which this is already happening. Let's see if this excites you so much that you'd like to not only participate in some of these processes, but also start to use some of these models to help solve some of the problems you and your profession or areas of interest face.</p>

<p>In my previous posting <a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/2007/12/moving-alom.html">&quot;Moving aLOM&quot;,</a> I mentioned some of the exciting, yet daunting, challenges of the future of metadata, such as how to create, in staggering volume, some of the more &quot;subjective&quot; metadata—things like the infinite characteristics that describe people, places, and things—where we humans are still the only source. This effort would include things like creating metadata for all the images and videos out there—still a largely unsolved problem—the absence of which not only makes them very hard to find, but also makes the Web and computers very inaccessible to the visually impaired, which, with age, might include a lot of us!</p>

<h3>The Exciting Work of Luis von Ahn</h3>

<p><a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/Luis%20von%20Ahn%20+%20Manuel.jpg"><img height="135" alt="Luis von Ahn   Manuel" src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/Luis%20von%20Ahn%20+%20Manuel_thumb.jpg" width="204" align="left" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a> Perhaps most notable in this area is a relatively young new professor at Carnegie Mellon University, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/" target="_blank">Luis von Ahn</a></span>, standing at right in this photo with his PhD advisor Manuel Blum. Luis has already completed some amazing work on what he refers to as &quot;human computation&quot; and how to put &quot;wasted&quot; human cycles to use in solving problems a computer cannot solve at this point in time, but humans can solve easily. Luis also picks up on a theme we have <em><a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/2007/11/the-encyclopedi.html" target="_blank">discussed here</a> on Off Course - On Target</em> in many other contexts—the power of the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect" target="_blank">&quot;network effect&quot;</a></span> achieved by connecting everything and every one together. Human computation is obviously focused on the latter, and Luis wants us to consider having all of our brains connected together as an extremely advanced large-scale distributive processing unit. Not to worry, no wires or direct connections to your head are required!</p>

<p>Before I go any further, and especially if you are more of a visual and auditory learner, let me recommend that you immediately watch this talk called <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143&amp;q=luis+von+ahn&amp;pr=goog-sl" target="_blank">&quot;Human Computation&quot;</a> that Luis gave on July 26, 2006, about the power of human cycles. This 51-minute talk is part of the <a href="http://almaer.com/techtalkshowcase/" target="_blank">Google Video Text Talk series</a> (also highly recommended), and while it is long by some current standards, I feel very comfortable recommending this to you, since I'm convinced you'll agree it was a VERY good use of your time (actually Luis' talk only runs 40 minutes, and is followed by about 10 minutes of a good Q&amp;A session). </p>

<p>Another excellent reference for you, which contains more fascinating details and examples of von Ahn's work, can be found in Clive Thompson's article <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/15-07/ff_humancomp" target="_blank">&quot;For Certain Tasks, the Cortex Still Beats the CPU&quot;</a>&nbsp; in the June 2007 edition of <em>Wired </em>magazine.</p>

<h3>Games with a Purpose</h3>

<p>But for those who don't have the time right now to look at these things more, here is a quick synthesis of what I find so exciting and interesting about the innovative use of our human &quot;compute cycles&quot;, and the use of &quot;fun and games&quot; for very significant and &quot;serious&quot; results. What von Ahn likes to call &quot;games with a purpose&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/captcha.gif"><img height="111" alt="captcha" src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/captcha_thumb.gif" width="272" align="left" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a> One of the most common and effective examples of this type of human computation is one of Luis' first applications, which is known as &quot;<a href="http://www.captcha.net/" target="_blank">Captcha</a>&quot;. The name may be new to you, but I'm sure you're already a veteran Captcha expert! Captchas are those slightly difficult to make out words that you are asked to identify and type into a box when you are signing up for web sites. Captchas are used for responses online and in other situations where we want to prevent automated &quot;bots&quot; from generating unending amounts of &quot;spam&quot; or other undesirable exploitations of such online experiences. The problem is how to differentiate between a human response and a computer response, and Captchas are a simple solution to this problem, as well as a simple example of a problem that computers can't solve by themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/captcha%20scanning.gif"><img height="92" alt="captcha scanning" src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/captcha%20scanning_thumb.gif" width="454" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a></p>

<p>In itself, this doesn't sound like that interesting of a problem, although certainly it is an annoying one! However, part of what I would see as Luis' brilliance is in the more primary problems he is solving with this process. </p>

<p>In the case of Captcha, the real problem being solved pertains to my initial reference about the challenge of digitizing all the content of the world's printed matter, such as books. For more background on this digitizing and scanning challenge, you may want to refer to my previous posting from Jan 2007 <a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/2007/01/booksthe_new_ol.html" target="_blank">&quot;Books—the NEW old medium&quot;</a>. Specifically, the problem is with all the words found in printed matter that scanning and conversion technology cannot make out, because the medium has a crease running through it, or it is partly missing, or other factors which make it impossible for the technology to recognize the words correctly.&nbsp; Yet, show these words to almost any one of us and we can easily recognize the word. </p>

<p>So all those &quot;fuzzy&quot; words in Captchas are NOT just some random words that are blurred to fool a computer. Instead, these are the images of words which scanning technology has failed to recognize correctly! Luis refers to this specific application as <a href="http://recaptcha.net/" target="_blank">ReCaptcha</a> and you'll find much more information there, as well as instructions and free plugins for you to embed within your own sites, blogs, etc. </p>

<p>And that's just one side of why Luis von Ahn was awarded one of the MacArthur &quot;Genius&quot; awards and a Microsoft Research grant, for he has also managed to put these types of solutions into a game format that starts to look at solving these kinds of problems at a scale that is truly breathtaking!&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Solving World Problems or Playing Solitaire?</h3>

<p>In his talks, Luis likes to use a very compelling metric of human-hours, and he often compares statistics on the the amount of human-hours that are &quot;wasted&quot;, in his opinion, doing something like playing Solitaire on a computer. I too have always been amazed at the number of people I observe when walking down the aisles of an airplane, for example, who are hard at &quot;work&quot; playing Solitaire, but I had no idea just how much time is spent on this. According to the statistics that Luis uses, over <strong>9 billion human-hours were expended playing Solitaire in 2003 alone!</strong> Better yet, he puts this into perspective by comparing this activity to such things as:</p>

<ul><li>The building of the New York City Empire State building, which consumed about 7 million human-hours, and thus equates to just 6.8 hours of collective Solitaire playing. </li>

<li>Building the entire Panama Canal, which took 20 million human-hours and amounts to less than a day of collective solitaire playing!</li></ul>

<h3>Metadata for All Images?</h3>

<p><a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/image_2.png"><img height="204" alt="image" src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_1.png" width="217" align="left" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a> Now imagine if we were able to put this kind of &quot;human computation&quot; to more effective use AND still do so within the format of games that people can enjoy doing themselves! One example is another one of Luis' creations, and one that has been running with staggering results for over three years called the <a href="http://www.espgame.org/" target="_blank">ESP Game</a>. As we've discussed many times, experiential &quot;learning by doing&quot; is often one of the best ways to learn about something new, so I'd encourage you to not only read about the ESP Game on that site, but to play it for awhile. (Caution: can be very addictive and time consuming!) When you do, you'll see how it puts two or more players (there is also a single player version) into a friendly competition by typing in descriptive words for a given photo (that metadata thing again), and they get points whenever they both type in the same word.</p>

<p>So what? While progress is being made in image recognition technology, this is still largely a problem that computers cannot do. And ask yourself, do YOU take the time to &quot;tag&quot; or create all the metadata for the photos and videos that YOU post, such as who and what is in the photo? Didn't think so. Yet by using this type of game format, the ESP Game has been running for over three years with no drop off in popularity and as of mid-2006, it was very fast, very cheap, and very accurate. If this were done as a popular online game site, it would be possible to label all the images on Google Image Search in just a few weeks! No surprise then that the ESP Game has already been licensed by Google in the form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Image_Labeler">Google Image Labeler</a>, and is used to improve the accuracy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Image_Search">Google Image Search</a>. We humans are relatively competitive animals and we like to do what we enjoy, so this approach appears to have a lot of promise.</p>

<h3>Yes, but WHERE is that object in the photo?</h3>

<p>Another problem that is even more challenging than identifying WHAT objects are in the image is identifying WHERE they are in the image. To do this, Luis has created another game called &quot;<a href="http://www.peekaboom.org/" target="_blank">PeekaBoom</a>&quot;. The first player sees an image along with a word that describes an object within the image, and then clicks on the image where the named object is located. The second player sees only the object that the first player clicked on and types the word associated to that object. Once the second player guesses the correct word, the two players move on to the next image and switch roles. More details are explained in the video (you really should take the time to watch it!).</p>

<h3>Human Computer Relations: Parasitic or Symbiotic?</h3>

<p>Luis also notes how this transforms the current relationship between humans and computers from what he calls a parasitic relationship to a symbiotic one where: </p><blockquote><p>&quot;...humans solve some problems, computers solve others, and together we work to create a better world.&quot; </p></blockquote><p>Sound far fetched? Well, in the less than two years that his limited experiment of the ESP Game has run, over 75,000 players have come up with over 15 million &quot;agreements&quot; (matched words). This rate would indicate that 5,000 players playing simultaneously could label all images on Google Images in about two months. Think about that...5,000 is NOT a very big number when you consider the numbers on many gaming sites. Therefore, it should be possible to <strong>label all the images on the Web in a few months</strong>. Again, I strongly recommend that you check out the video to get not only more details, but to see just how accurate, pragmatic, and promising this approach is.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For example, it turns out that the results of a game such as PeekaBoom can in turn be used to help train computers to recognize objects and their location. Turns out that one of the reasons that computers are not yet very good at this type of object recognition and automated metadata generation is that there is very little data and examples to use to &quot;train&quot; the computers on how to do it. By capturing the results of all the human play in location identification of objects within images, this data can then be used to train computers to do the same thing&quot;—allowing us move on to new challenges... and more fun.</p>

<h3>Super Side Effects</h3>

<p>I think you'll agree that this approach not only shows great promise in terms of solving some very large scale problems, but has some surprising and equally amazing &quot;side effects&quot;, like how some people have used this to help them learn a language. This approach has spawned its own game called <strong><a href="http://playbabble.com/" target="_blank">Babble</a></strong>, where two English-speaking players are shown a sentence in a foreign language that neither of them speak, and are presented with a list of possible meanings (in English) below each word. Players try to agree upon a set of English words that forms the most coherent sentence. The result is that this activity is surprisingly effective in translating foreign text into English without requiring anyone fluent in both languages. Think of the possibilities of this running at a larger scale!</p>

<p>Another &quot;side effect&quot; of this approach is how many players have noted that they end up finding other people who think very much like them, and thus they have a great sense of &quot;intimacy&quot; and closeness with their counterparts who play these games. Therefore, many&nbsp; ask if they can find out who their anonymous competitors are to continue the conversation. At this point in time, all the game players are anonymous and no identities are revealed, but one could imagine this being used as a way to help discover other people &quot;like you&quot;—ones you'd want to meet and get to know better.</p>

<h3>Common Sense Isn't that Common; yet!</h3>

<p>And lastly from von Ahn's work, check out his new game <a href="http://www.peekaboom.org/cgi-bin/verbosity/play_game?id=NULL" target="_blank">Verbosity</a>, which helps to generate what he calls &quot;common sense facts&quot; (again just more metadata really). One player is given a word and the other tries to guess what it is by completing fill-in-the-blank-type templates, such as &quot;It is a type of ____&quot; or &quot;It contains ___&quot;.&nbsp; The player who entered the original word can answer &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, but can't use the word itself. All this is very much like some party games that many of you have probably played, but the important difference here goes back to the original point of the summative network effect and how this can all be put to greater use. In the example that Luis shows in his presentation, the word &quot;milk&quot; would have some common sense facts such as;</p>

<ul><li>It is white </li>

<li>It is a liquid </li>

<li>It is often used to eat cereal </li>

<li>It has lactose</li></ul>

<p>Again, computers can not currently solve this kind of problem, and it is another an example of the need for massive amounts of metadata. Imagine if we started generating massive volumes of these &quot;common sense facts&quot; and they were readily available to all.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>More Competition = Less Carbon?</h3>

<p><a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/carbonRally_270x265.png"><img height="213" alt="carbonRally_270x265" src="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/WindowsLiveWriter/carbonRally_270x265_thumb.png" width="217" align="left" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a> Lest you should think this is just a &quot;one man show&quot; from Luis von Ahn, I want to point out that there are many others who have been developing, adopting, and adapting similar models. For example, &quot;<a href="http://www.carbonrally.com/" target="_blank">Carbonrally: Carbon Challenge</a>&quot;, which you can learn more about from the Nov. 20th, 2007 <em>Webware</em> post &quot;<a href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9821041-2.html">Carbonrally: My carbon footprint's smaller than yours</a>&quot; by <a href="http://www.webware.com/8300-1_109-2.html?authorId=128">Martin LaMonica</a>, is an application that is showing some great promise for improving the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions or the &quot;carbon footprint&quot; of individuals and organizations alike. Carbonrally adds the dimension of some fun and healthy competition to do better than others. As Martin describes it, Carbonrally is &quot;tapping into people's tribal competitive spirit&quot;.</p>

<p>Whew!&nbsp; That's quite an introduction to what I believe is both a powerful and profound pattern emerging—where the natural pursuit of fun, healthy competition, and challenges are combined into a game-based model that has already shown some of the ways we can solve large-scale present and future problems. It also creates a whole new relationship between us and technology. This model is not only interesting and fun, but it is a fascinating example of &quot;user generated metadata&quot;, which I mentioned in my <span style="color: #000000;">previous <a href="http://waynehodgins.typepad.com/ontarget/2007/12/moving-alom.html">&quot;Moving aLOM&quot;</a> posting.</span></p>

<h3>Your Turn to Play!</h3>

<p>Besides raising your awareness about &quot;human computation&quot; and the power of this approach, I also want to encourage all of us to put more time and energy into figuring out how we can inject more fun into work and other problem-solving situations. As you do so, I think you'll see an important job or task or problem&nbsp; can be more fun if it's solved with some kind of game play, and where the solution remains very much a human one.</p>

<p>We can not, for now at least, expect computers to come up with such fun and game-based solutions by themselves!&nbsp; </p>

<p>For starters, if you have websites or other applications where you have problems preventing spam or other misuses, consider taking advantage of some of the freely available plugins and nullities, such as those from the <a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html" target="_blank">ReCaptcha site</a>. Longer term though, please put some thought into which problems you could address with this model, and the ways you could do so by injecting the fun and challenge of a game-based approach into the more serious problems you need to solve...then share them with us here at <em>Off Course - On Target</em>.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of the great quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Sutton-Smith" target="_blank">Brian Suton-Smith</a> who said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The opposite of play is not work; its depression!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>And I look forward to hearing all the innovative and creative ways you will come up with to solve problems—large and small—and replace depression with play. Have fun!</p>
