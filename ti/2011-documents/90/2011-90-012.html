			<li>Project Topics</li>
				<ul>
				<li> Robust Query Execution Plans: The SEER and EXPAND approaches are successful in identifying query
execution plans that are relatively robust to selectivity estimation
errors on the base relations of the query. The goal of this project is
to analyze and assess whether it would be feasible to extend the
robustness approach to higher levels in the plan operator tree, and
ultimately, the whole plan tree itself. As a case in point, providing
robustness to errors in join selectivity estimations.</li>

<li> Reverse Plan Mapping: Given a query template and the identities of the optimal plans
featuring in the associated parameter space - that is, the set of POSP
plans appearing in the plan diagram, the goal of this project is to
efficiently locate some location in the parameter space wherein a
particular POSP plan $P_i$ is optimal. In a nutshell, to find a
reverse mapping from plans to parameters. </li>

<li> Semantically Quantifying Plan Difference: While it is relatively clear to decide when two query execution plans are semantically different, an unsolved but critical and fundamental problem is to quantify the distance between two plans. The goal of this project is to devise a combination of structural and cost-based metrics that are semantically meaningful from a database perspective, and use these metrics to characterize database system behavior.</li>

<li> Biometric databases, such as the fingerprint repository used in the UID project, are characterized by having a large number of features, numbering in the several hundreds. For such databases, traditional multi-dimensional indexes fail to scale up, and it is neccessary to use new strategies suc as the Pyramid Tree index. The goal of this project is to design, implement and evaluate a Pyramid-Tree-based high-dimensional index for the Postgres-based fingerprint database available in DSL.Database Engine Design and Analysis</li>

Association rule mining requires prohibitive computational effort on
massive datasets. Therefore, mining a random sample of the database has
been proposed as a way to speed up the process. In the literature, a
formal study of the sample size required to ensure certain desired levels of accuracy was considered, and it was shown that the sample size required is independent of the number of tuples in the database, depending instead on the length of the longest transaction.

Our empirical assessment has indicated that the above bound is very loose - by a factor of one to two orders of magnitude.  The goal of this project is to investigate modifications to the original analyses so as to come up with significantly tighter bounds on the sampling effort. For example, replacing the extremely general but equally weak Chernoff bounds used in the analysis with tighter bounds based on distributional assumptions about the correlations present in the database.</li>

<li>(Jointly offered with Dr. Prasad Deshpande of IBM Research)<br/>
Multi-dimensional Data Mining: In this project we will explore the impact of multi-dimensional data in
data mining. Data mining involves learning models from historical data and using these models to predict future behavior. An example is association rule mining from transaction data that discover high probability associations between items that occur together in a transaction. Very often the transaction data is multi-dimensional in nature. For example, in Sales transaction data, the dimensions could be Location, Time, Customer etc, which enable more interesting analysis. By selecting values along different dimensions, we get a subset of the entire transactions. The model of behavior in different subsets may be different. For example, behavior of customers in India may be different from customers in the US. We have done some work on fast association rule mining on arbitrarily chosen subsets of multi-dimensional data (to appear in SDM 2011). We would like to explore some related problems in this space. A specific problem is to decide what subset of data to use for predicting behavior. For example, if we want to predict the behavior of a particular customer and we have a lot of historical data about that customer, we can build a model based on the data for that customer. However, very often, we may not have sufficient data for each customer to build an accurate model. In that case, we could expand the scope and use data about related customers to build the model. There is a trade-off that needs to be studied. If we expand the scope too much, we may use data irrelevant to the customer in building the model. If the scope is too small, we will not have sufficient data to build an accurate model. Different dimensions present different ways of expanding the scope of the data. Thus choosing an optimal scope to use for building the model in the presence of dimensions is an interesting problem.</li>

<li> (Jointly offered with Dr. Prasad Deshpande of IBM Research)<br/>
Information Extraction: A large percentage of data is unstructured text data. Information extraction is the process of extracting structured data from unstructured text. The extracted information can be used to complete missing information, resolve entities or BI kind of applications. Information extraction is a well studied area and there are two main approaches - machine learning and rule based. In machine learning approaches, a training set consisting of manually tagged data is used to learn a model. This model can then be used on new data to extract the relevant information. Classification and CRF based methods are examples of these approaches. In rule based information extraction, rules are written manually to extract the information. Machine learning based methods are good when there is a lot of noise and variations in the input data. Rule based methods work well when there are well defined patterns, thus making it possible to write high precision rules. In this project, we will explore whether it makes sense to combine both these approaches. It may be possible to leverage the strengths of each method and combine them in such a way that the net result is better that using only learning based or rule based methods.</li>

				<ul>
				<li>Testing and verification of database-driven applications: Many business applications such as ticket booking and online shopping use GUI's to interact with users, and use databases to store persistent data.  Testing these applications is notoriously difficult because of the large number of different usage scenarios; the problem becomes even harder in the presence of concurrent users. The goal of this project is to devise modeling notations to represent these applications, and to develop a system to test and verify the applications using the models. This project will be collaboration with Arnab De, a PhD student in the department.
<ul><li>Pre-requisites: Program Analysis and Verification OR Formal Methods in Software Engineering OR Automated Verification OR Automata Theory OR Compilers.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Specializing programs by term rewriting: A "monolithic" program is one that takes a collection of input items, perhaps of different kinds, and processes each item using specialized logic for each input kind. There is rich literature in the area of representing programming languages as term-rewriting systems (term-rewriting is a kind of rule-driven graph transformation). An objective of this project is to devise an algorithm for taking a monolithic program, and specializing it to different variants of the program for the different input kinds, using term rewrite operations. An additional objective is to argue the correctness and completeness of the algorithm. This project requires the student to first
gain understanding of some important existing theoretical techniques, and then develop the algorithm.

			<li>Project Topics</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Probabilistic Models for Dialogue: The goal of this project will be to design probabilistic models for human dialogue. Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation look to identify topics from collections of documents. When author information is available, author-topic models look to identify author-specific topics. In this project, the focus will be on two-party conversation data and designing models for how topics evolve during
conversations.  Efficient learning and inference  algorithms will also need to be designed for proposed models.</li>
<li>Interactive Models for Topic Discovery: Topics discovered by unsupervised learning using models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation are often not meaningful or useful for the user. In exploratory topic discovery, when it may not be possible for the user to specify his preferences ahead of time, critiquing discovered topics and topic assignments is often easier. The goal of this project will be to investigate different types of feedback that can be provided by the user for topic discovery, and then look at how topic models can be extended to learn from such interactive feedback to discover more meaningful topics.</li>
<li>Clustering with Preferences: For a clustering task, it is often possible for the user to provide clustering preferences, in the form of multiple source data-sets and their preferred clusterings. Given these preferred clusterings on multiple source datasets, the clustering algorithm, in addition to grouping similar items in the target data, has to align the target clusters as much as possible with the source clusters. In this project, we will look at how to appropriately modify the k-means objective function and the optimization algorithm to handle multiple source preferences.</li>

			<li>Project Topics</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Cognitive Markup Language (CML): In the course of my investigations in the area of cognitive science, I have invented a modeling paradigm which I call the cognitive markup language (CML). CML will be analogous to the various markup languages used for computer based information processing. It will have in addition many other tag schemes to model perceptual, cognitive and emotional information. We will draw upon studies from computational  linguistics, formal languages, natural language processing and cognitive neuroscience to develop the CML. The proof of the conceptual schemata pudding will consist in sound implementation work using scripting and parallel programming environment, and corroborating the model data with experimental data (see next topic). </li>
			<li>Cognitive Psycholinguistic Analytics (CSA): In the course of my investigations in the area of cognitive science, I am having several close encounters with a variety of networks and graphs. We plan to investigate various network models and analysis of what I call graph parametrics and graph concordances. The input to this system will come from eye-tracker and simulation experiments on the visual field of perception. We will study text input and reading tasks.</li>
			<li>Cryptanalysis - Theory and Practice (CTP): This is a continuation of our ongoing projects of practical and large-scale cryptanalysis tasks in the areas of integer factoring, discrete logarithms and pass-phrase hashing. I would like to augment the computational frameworks developed by us with additional theoretical heuristics and information based on hum-int (human intelligence), to build more effective cracking systems.</li>

			<li>Project Topics</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The "nearby friends problem" models the scenario where two parties communicate to find out whether they are in geographically close locations or not without disclosing their (secret) location  
information. A few solutions for this problem is known in two-dimensional space. We are interested to investigate this question in more general setting. In particular, we want to formulate the problem in three dimensional space involving more than two parties. Such a protocol  might find application in some strategic situations, e.g., a submarine can find out whether there are  other (allied) submarines, ships or air-crafts nearby without first disclosing its own location.</li>
			<li>Two party key aggrement is an important cryptographic primitive used in many higher level security applications. In 2009, the U.S. government's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published SP 800-56B, a standard that specifies several RSA-based two party key agreement schemes. Two key agreements protocols, KAS1 and KAS2, are presented in SP 800-56B, as well as two key transport protocols. Contrary to conventional cryptographic wisdom, SP 800-56B explicitly permits a party to use its static  key pair in more than one of the key agreement schemes. This is a little surprising since the KAS1 and KAS2 protocols have noticeably different security attributes and  interference attacks on the runs of two protocols  can render one of the protocols insecure. We want to specify a shared security model
that incorporates the individual security attributes of KAS1 and KAS2, and formally verify that the protocols are secure even 
when static key pairs are reused.</li>
