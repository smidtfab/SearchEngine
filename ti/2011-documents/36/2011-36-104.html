				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This provocative question materialized during a recent conversation I had with a Professor of Political Science whilst in New York in this week. Major news companies like CNN have started to crowdsource citizen generated news on the basis that “looking at the news from different angles gives us a deeper understanding of what’s going on.” <a href="http://www.ireporter.com">CNN’s iReporter</a> thus invites citizens to help shape the news “in order to paint a more complete picture of the news.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would imply that traditional journalism has provided a relatively incomplete picture of global events. So the question is, if crowdsourcing platforms had been available to journalists one hundred years ago, would they view these platforms as an exciting opportunity to get early leads on breaking stories? The common counter argument is: but crowdsourcing “opens the floodgates” of information and we simply can&#8217;t follow up on everything. Yes, but whoever said that every lead requires follow up?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Journalists are not always interested in following up on every lead that comes their way. They’ll select a few sources, interview them and then write up the story. What crowdsourcing citizen generated news does, however, is to provide them with many more leads to <em>choose</em> from. Isn’t this an ideal set up for a journalist? Instead of having to chase down leads across town, the leads come directly to them with names, phone numbers and email addresses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine that the field of journalism had started out using crowdsourcing platforms combined with investigative journalism. If these platforms were then outlawed for whatever reason, would investigative journalists be hindered in their ability to cover the news from different angles? Or would they still be able to paint an equally complete picture of the news?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Granted, one common criticism of citizen journalism is the lack of context they provide especially when using Twitter given the 140 characters restriction. But surely 140 characters are plenty for the purposes of a potential lead. And if a mountain of Tweets started to point to the same lead story, then a professional journalist could take advantage of this information when deciding whether or not to follow up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<div id="attachment_2844" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://coolthing.net"><img class="size-full wp-image-2844" title="telegram" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/telegram.jpg?w=500&#038;h=378" alt="" width="500" height="378" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: CoolThing</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also find the criticism against Twitter interesting coming from traditional journalists. In the early 1900s, large newspapers started hiring war correspondents “who used the new telegraph and expanding railways to move news faster to their newspapers.” However, the cost of sending telegrams forced reporters to develop a “new concise or ‘tight’ style of writing which became the standard for journalism through the next century.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, the costs of hiring professional journalists means that a newspaper like the <em>Herald </em>(at the time),  is not going to send any modern <a title="Henry Stanley" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stanley">Henry Stanley</a> to find a certain <a title="David Livingstone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Livingstone">Dr. Livingstone</a> in Africa. And besides, if the <em>Herald </em>had global crowdsourcing platforms back in the 1870s, they may have instead used Twitter to crowdsource the coordinates of Dr. Livingstone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This may imply that traditional journalism was primarily shaped by the constraint of technology at the time. In a teleological sense, then, crowdsourcing may simply by the next phase in the future of journalism.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;">When Wired journalist Jeff Howe <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">coined the term crowdsourcing</a> back<em> </em>in 2006, he did so in contradistinction to the term <em>outsourcing</em> and defined crowdsourcing as tapping the talent of the crowd. The tag line of his article was: “Remember outsourcing? Sending jobs to India and China is so 2003. The new pool of cheap labor: everyday people using their spare cycles to create content, solve problems, even do corporate R &amp; D.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I had a tag line for this blog post it would be: “Remember crowdsourcing? Cheap labor to create content and solve problems using the Internet is so 2006. What’s new and cool today is the tapping of official and unofficial sources using new technologies to create and validate quality content.” I would call this <strong>allsourcing</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “crowdsourcing” is obviously a compound word that combines “crowd” and “sourcing”. But what exactly does “crowd” mean in this respect? And how has “sourcing” changed since Jeff introduced the term crowdsourcing over three-and-a-half years ago?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lets tackle the question of “sourcing” first. In his June 2006 article on crowdsourcing, Jeff provides case studies that all relate to a novel application of a website and perhaps the most famous example of crowdsourcing is Wikipedia, another website. But we’ve just recently seen some interesting uses of mobile phones to crowdsource information. See <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> or <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/et2009/public/schedule/detail/5369">Nathan Eagle’s talk at ETech09,</a> for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display:block;'><object width='500' height='312'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/Ivz2foChQYU?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/Ivz2foChQYU?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='500' height='312' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the word &#8220;sourcing&#8221; here goes beyond the website-based e-business approach that Jeff originally wrote about in 2006. The mobile technology component here is key. A “crowd” is not still. A crowd moves, especially in crisis, which is my area of interest. So the term “allsourcing” not only implies collecting information from all sources but also the use of &#8220;all&#8221; technologies to collect said information in different media.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the word “crowd”, I recently noted in <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/12/16/three-misconceptions/">this Ushahidi blog post</a> that we may need some qualifiers—namely bounded and unbounded crowdsourcing. In other words, the term “crowd” can  mean a large group of people (unbounded crowdsourcing) or perhaps a specific group (bounded crowdsourcing). Unbounded crowdsourcing implies that the identity of individuals reporting the information is unknown whereas bounded crowdsourcing would describe a known group of individuals supplying information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term “allsourcing” represents a combination of bounded and unbounded crowdsourcing coupled with new “sourcing” technologies. An allsourcing approach would combined information supplied by known/official sources and unknown/unofficial sources using the Web, e-mail, SMS, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube etc. I think the future of crowdsourcing is allsourcing because allsourcing combines the strengths of both bounded and unbounded approaches while reducing the constraints inherent to each individual approach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let me explain. One main important advantage of unbounded crowdsourcing is the ability to collect information from unofficial sources. I consider this an advantage over bounded crowdsourcing since more information can be collected this way. The challenge of course is how to verify the validity of said information. Verifying information is by no means a new process, but unbounded crowdsourcing has the potential to generate a lot more information than bounded crowdsourcing since the former does not censor unofficial content. This presents a challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the same time, bounded crowdsourcing has the advantage of yielding reliable information since the reports are produced by known/official sources. However, bounded crowdsourcing is constrained to a relatively small number of individuals doing the reporting. Obviously, these individuals cannot be everywhere at the same time. But if we combined bounded and unbounded crowdsourcing, we would see an increase in (1) overall reporting, and (2) in the ability to validate reports from unknown sources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The increased ability to validate information is due to the fact that official and unofficial sources can be triangulated when using an allsourcing approach. Given that official sources are considered trusted sources, any reports from unofficial sources that match official reports can be considered more reliable along with their associated sources. And so the combined allsourcing approach in effect enables the identification of new reliable sources even if the identify of these sources remains unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ushahidi is good example of an allsourcing platform. Organizations can use Ushahidi to capture both official and unofficial sources using all kinds of new sourcing technologies. Allsourcing is definitely something new so there’s still much to learn. I have a hunch that there is huge potential. Jeff Howe titled his famous article in Wired “The Rise of Crowdsourcing.” Will a future edition of Wired include an article on “The Rise of Allsourcing”?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Here are three interesting <strong>misconceptions</strong> about Ushahidi and crowdsourcing in general:</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<ol>
<li>Ushahidi takes the lead in deploying the Ushahidi platform</li>
<li>Crowdsourced information is statistically representative</li>
<li>Crowdsourced information cannot be validated</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lets start with the first.</strong> We do not take the lead in deploying Ushahidi platforms. In fact, we often learn about new deployments second-hand via Twitter. We are a non-profit tech company and our goal is to continue developing innovative crowdsourcing platforms that cater to the growing needs of our current and prospective partners. We provide technical and strategic support when asked but otherwise you’ll find us in the backseat, which is honestly where we prefer to be. Our comparative advantage is not in deployment. So the credit for Ushahidi deployments really go the numerous organizations that continue to implement the platform in new and innovative ways.</p>
<p>On this note, keep in mind that the first downloadable Ushahidi platform was made available just this May, and the second version just last week. So implementing organizations have been remarkable test pilots, experimenting and learning on the fly without recourse to any particular manual or documented best practices. Most election-related deployments, for example, were even launched <em>before May</em>, when platform stability was still an issue and the code was still being written. So our hats go off to all the organizations that have piloted Ushahidi and continue to do so. They are the true pioneers in this space.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that these organizations rarely had more than a month or two of lead-time before scheduled elections, like in India. If all of us have learned anything from watching these deployments in 2009, it is this: the challenge is not one of technology but election awareness and voter education. So we’re impressed that several organizations are already customizing the Ushahidi platform for elections that are more than 6-12 months away. These deployments will definitely be a first for Ushahidi and we look forward to learning all we can from implementing organizations.</p>
<p><strong>The second misconception</strong>, “crowdsourced information is statistically representative,” often crops up in conversations around election monitoring. The problem is largely one of language. The field of election monitoring is hardly new. Established organizations have been involved in election monitoring for decades and have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in this area. For these organizations, the term “election monitoring” has specific connotations, such as random sampling and statistical analysis, verification, validation and accredited election monitors.</p>
<p>When partners use Ushahidi for election monitoring, I think they mean something different. What they generally mean is citizen-powered election monitoring aided by crowdsourcing. Does this imply that crowdsourced information is statistically representative of all the events taking place across a given country? Of course not: I’ve never heard anyone suggest that crowdsourcing is equivalent to random sampling.</p>
<p>Citizen-powered election monitoring is about empowering citizens to take ownership over their elections and to have a voice. Indeed, elections do not start and stop at the polling booth. Should we prevent civil society groups from crowdsourcing crisis information on the basis that their reports may not be statistically representative? No. This is not our decision to make and the data is not even meant for us.</p>
<p>Another language-related problem has to due with the term “crowdsourcing”. The word  “crowd” here can literally mean anyone (unbounded crowdsourcing) or a specific group (bounded crowdsourcing) such as designated election monitors. If these official monitors use Ushahidi and they are deliberately positioned across a country for random sampling purposes, then this becomes no different at all to standard and established approaches to election monitoring. Bounded crowdsourcing can be statistically representative.</p>
<p><strong>The third misconception</strong> about Ushahidi has to do with the tradeoff between unbounded crowdsourcing and the validation of said crowdsourced information. One of the main advantages of unbounded crowdsourcing is the ability to collect a lot of information from a variety of sources and media—official and nonofficial sources—in near real time. Of course, this means that a lot more of information can be reported at once, which can make the validation of said information a challenging process.</p>
<p>A common reaction to this challenge is to dismiss crowdsourcing altogether because unofficial sources may be unreliable or at worse deliberately misleading. Some organizations thus find it easier to write off all unofficial content because of these concerns. Ushahidi takes a different stance. We recognize that user-generated content is not about to disappear any time soon and that a lot of good can come out of such content, not least because official information can too easily become proprietary and guarded instead of shared.</p>
<p>So we’re not prepared to write off user-generated content because validating information happens to be challenging. Crowdsourcing crisis information is our business and so is (obviously) the validation of crowdsourced information. This is why Ushahidi is <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/12/14/jon-gosier-joins-the-swift-river-initiative/">fully committed</a> to developing <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/04/09/explaining-swift-river/">Swift River</a> by early 2010. Swift is a free and open source platform that validates crowdsourced information in near real-time. Follow the Ushahidi blog for exciting updates!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I’ve already blogged about what <a href="http://earlywarning.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/an-ecosystem-approach-to-conflict-early-warningresponse/">an ecosystem approach</a> to conflict early warning and response entails. But I have done so with a country focus rather than thinking globally. This blog post applies a global perspective to the ecosystem approach given the proliferation of new platforms with global scalability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps the most apt analogy here is one of food webs where the food happens to be information. Organisms in a food web are grouped into primary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers. Primary producers such as grass harvest an energy source such as sunlight that they turn into biomass. Herbivores are primary consumers of this biomass while carnivores are secondary consumers of herbivores. There is thus a clear relationship known as a food chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an excellent video visualizing food web dynamics produced by researchers affiliated with the Santa Fe Institute (<a href="http://www.santafe.edu">SFI</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display:block;'><object width='500' height='312'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/VxYM-RgVqTI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/VxYM-RgVqTI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='500' height='312' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our information web (or Info Web) is also composed of multiple producers and consumers of information each interlinked by communication technology in increasingly connected ways. Indeed, primary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers also crawl and dynamically populate the Info Web. But the shock of the information revolution is altering the food chains in our ecosystem. Primary consumers of information can now be primary producers, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the smallest unit of analysis, individuals are the most primary producers of information. The mainstream media, social media, natural language parsing tools, crowdsourcing platforms, etc, arguably comprise the primary consumers of that information. Secondary consumers are larger organisms such as the global Emergency Information Service (<a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/01/11/eis/">EIS</a>) and the Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert System (<a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/global-vulnerability-alert-gva-a-new-early-warning-initiative/">GIVAS</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These newly forming platforms are at different stages of evolution. EIS and GIVAS are relatively embryonic while the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination Systems (GDACS) and Google Earth are far more evolved. A relatively new organism in the Info Web is the <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/un-world-food-program-to-use-uavs/">UAV</a> as exemplified by <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/un-world-food-program-to-use-uavs/">ITHACA</a>. The BrightEarth Humanitarian Sensor Web (SensorWeb) is further along the information chain while <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>’s Crisis Mapping platform and the <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/moving-forward-with-swift-river/">Swift River driver</a> are more mature but have not yet deployed as a global instance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.instedd.org">InSTEDD</a>’s <a href="http://instedd.org/geochat">GeoChat</a>, <a href="http://instedd.org/evolve">Riff</a> and <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2008/11/22/instedds-mesh4x-explained/">Mesh4X</a> solutions have already iterated through a number of generations. So have <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/dbc.nsf/doc100?OpenForm">ReliefWeb</a> and the Humanitarian Information Unit (<a href="http://www.state.gov/s/inr/hiu/">HIU</a>). There are of course additional organisms in this ecosystem, but the above list should suffice to demonstrate my point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What if we connected these various organisms to catalyze a super organism? A Global System of Systems (<strong>GSS</strong>)? Would the whole—a global system of systems for crisis mapping and early warning—be greater than the sum of its parts? Before we can answer this question in any reasonable way, we need to know the characteristics of each organism in the ecosystem. These organisms represent the threads that may be woven into the GSS, a global web of crisis mapping and early warning systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/picture-61.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2555" title="Global System of Systems" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/picture-61.png?w=500&#038;h=624" alt="Global System of Systems" width="500" height="624" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Emergency Information Service (EIS)</strong> is slated to be a unified communications solution linking citizens, journalists, governments and non-governmental organizations in a seamless flow of timely, accurate and credible information—even when local communication infrastructures are rendered inoperable. This feature will be made possible by utilizing SMS as the communications backbone of the system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the event of a crisis, the EIS team would sift, collate, make sense of and verify the myriad of streams of information generated by a large humanitarian intervention. The team would gather information from governments, local media, the military, UN agencies and local NGOs to develop reporting that will be tailored to the specific needs of the affected population and translated into local languages. EIS would work closely with local media to disseminate messages of critical, life saving information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert System (GIVAS) </strong>is being designed to closely monitor vulnerabilities and accelerate communication between the time a global crisis hits and when information reaches decision makers through official channels. The system is mandated to provide the international community with early, real-time evidence of how a global crisis is affecting the lives of the poorest and to provide decision-makers with real time information to ensure that decisions take the needs of the most vulnerable into account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>BrightEarth Humanitarian Sensor Web (SensorWeb) </strong>is specifically designed for UN field-based agencies to improve real time situational awareness. The dynamic mapping platform enables humanitarians to easily and quickly map infrastructure relevant for humanitarian response such as airstrips, bridges, refugee camps, IDP camps, etc. The SensorWeb is also used to map events of interest such as cholera outbreaks. The platform leverages mobile technology as well as social networking features to encourage collaborative analytics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ushahidi </strong>integrates web, mobile and dynamic mapping technology to crowdsource crisis information. The platform uses FrontlineSMS and can be deployed quickly as a crisis unfolds. Users can visualize events of interest on a dynamic map that also includes an animation feature to visualize the reported data over time and space.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Swift River </strong>is under development but designed to validate crowdsourced information in real time by combining machine learning for predictive tagging with human crowdsourcing for filtering purposes. The purpsose of the platform is to create veracity scores to denote the probability of an event being true when reported across several media such as Twitter, Online news, SMS, Flickr, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>GeoChat and Mesh4X </strong>could serve as the nodes connecting the above platforms in dynamic ways. Riff could be made interoperable with Swift River.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Can such a global Info Web be catalyzed? The question hinges on several factors the most important of which are probably awareness and impact. The more these individual organisms know about each other, the better picture they will have of the potential synergies between their efforts and then find incentives to collaborate. This is one of the main reasons I am co-organizing the first International Conference on Crisis Mapping (<a href="http://www.crisismapping.net">ICCM 2009</a>) next week.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://search.forbes.com/search/colArchiveSearch?author=dan+and+woods&amp;aname=Dan+Woods">Dan Woods</a> had an <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/09/28/crowdsourcing-enterprise-innovation-technology-cio-network-jargonspy.html">interesting piece in Forbes Magazine</a> last month that labels crowdsourcing as a myth. As Dan puts it, the popular press and millions of people are deluded in thinking that &#8220;there is a crowd that solves problem better than individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dan writes that&#8230;</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li> The notion of crowds creating solutions appeals to our desire to believe that working together we can do anything, but in terms of innovation it is just ridiculous.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>There is no crowd in crowdsourcing. There are only virtuosos, usually uniquely talented, highly trained people who have worked for decades in a field. [...] From their fervent brains spring new ideas. The crowd has nothing to do with it. The crowd solves nothing, creates nothing.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>What really happens in crowdsourcing as it is practiced in wide variety of contexts, from Wikipedia to open source to scientific research, is that a problem is broadcast to a large number of people with varying forms of expertise. Then individuals motivated by obsession, competition, money or all three apply their individual talent to creating a solution.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>What bugs me is that misplaced faith in the crowd is a blow to the image of the heroic inventor. We need to nurture and fund inventors and give them time to explore, play and fail. A false idea of the crowd reduces the motivation for this investment, with the supposition that companies can tap the minds of inventors on the cheap.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Whatever term we use, let&#8217;s not call it crowdsourcing and pretend that 10,000 average Joes invent better products than Steve Jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dan certainly makes some valid points. But when<em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">Wired </a></em><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">journalist Jeff Howe coined the term</a> in 2006, he did so to differentiate the process from &#8220;outsourcing&#8221;, from whence the term crowdsourcing originates. In his own words, crowdsourcing describes a process when tasks are opened to anyone as a way &#8220;to tap the talent of the crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I looked up the <a href="http://www.answers.com/talent">definition of the word talent</a> and sure enough the term can be used to describe both a person and a group. Clearly Dan takes issue with the <em>semantics</em> of the term crowdsourcing since he sees this as misleading and unfair to those who do most of the innovative work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In context of the Internet, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29">1 % rule or the 90-9-1 principle</a> reflects an observation that &#8220;more people will lurk in a virtual community than will participate. This term is often used as a euphemism for participation inequality in the context of the Internet.&#8221; What is often overlooked, however, is that this 1% figure is one percent of a <em>growing</em> number given the increasing access to the Web around the world. So the 1% figure does constitute a crowd; a self-selected crowd for sure, but a crowd nevertheless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In terms of innovation, new ideas are not isolated islands of thought. Ideas tend to ricochet off different minds. Innovation doesn&#8217;t occur in a vacuum; there is always context.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why have have innovation labs otherwise? Why cluster in Silicon Valley?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I certainly respect individual talent and absolutely believe that individuals should get credit for their work, I feel that Dan&#8217;s article is bent on establishing ownership and safeguarding proprietary rights, i.e., control. This stands in contrast to the crowdsourcing approach which has individuals contribute without controlling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps <em>elite</em>sourcing is the term that the author would prefer? But as James Surowiecki notes in his best seller, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">The Wisdom of the Crowds</a>&#8220;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them. Groups do not need to be dominated by exceptionally intelligent people in order to be smart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also confusion with respect to micro-motives and macro-behavior, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behavior">emergent behavior</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence">Swarm intelligence</a> also comes to mind. When we see a flock of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm#Birds">birds seemingly &#8220;dancing&#8221;</a> in the sky as if one entity, this is emergent behavior driven by local synchronization. Does this mean we value the individual birds any less? Of course not. When we say that &#8220;it takes a village to raise a child&#8221; do we devalue individual parents and family members? Surely not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We credit the crowd because no one person lives in a vacuum and comes up with innovative ideas that are completely independent from their interaction with the outside world.</p>

				<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a short video of the presentation I will be giving at the Leir Conference on <strong>The Next Generation of Human Rights</strong>. My talk focuses on the use of digital technologies to leverage the <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/ushahidi-from-croudsourcing-to-crowdfeeding/">crowdsourcing and crowdfeeding</a> of human rights information. I draw on <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/moving-forward-with-swift-river/">Ushahidi&#8217;s Swift River</a> initiative to describe how crowdsourced information can be auto-validated.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an update on the latest Swift River open group meeting that took place this morning at the <a href="http://www.instedd.org">InSTEDD</a> office in Palo Alto. <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/ksjhalla">Kaushal Jhalla</a> first proposed the idea behind Swift River after the terrorist attacks on Mumbai last November. Ushahidi has since taken on the initiative as a <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/02/04/crisis-info-crowdsourcing-the-filter/">core project</a> since the goal of Swift River is central to the group&#8217;s mission: the crowdsourcing of crisis information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kaushal and<a href="http://unthinkingly.com/"> Chris Blow</a> gave the first <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/04/09/explaining-swift-river">formal presentation</a> of Swift River during our first Ushahidi strategy meeting in Orlando last March where we formally established the Swift River group, which includes <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/">Andrew Turner</a>, <a href="http://younoodle.com/people/sean_gourley">Sean Gourely</a>, <a href="http://whiteafrican.com/">Erik Hersman</a> and myself in addition to Kaushal and Chris. Andrew has played a pivotal role in getting Swift River and Vote Report India off the ground and I highly recommend reading his <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/swiftriver-and-crowd-curating-the-crowd-source/">blog post on the initiative</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The group now includes several new friends of Ushahidi, a number of whom kindly shared their time and insights this morning after Chris kicked off the meeting to bring everyone up to speed.  The purpose of this blog post is to outline how I hope Swift River moves forward based on this morning&#8217;s fruitful session. Please see my <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/04/10/developing-swift-river-to-validate-crowdsourcing/">previous blog post</a> for an overview of the basic methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose of the Swift River platform, as I proposed this morning, is to provide two core services. The first, to borrow <a href="http://www.gauravonomics.com/">Guarva Mishra</a>&#8216;s description, is to crowdsource the tagging of crisis information. The second is to triangulate the tagged information to assign reality scores to individual events. Confused? Not to worry, it&#8217;s actually really straightforward.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Crowdsourcing Tagging</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Information on a developing crisis can be captured from several text-based sources such articles from online news media, Tweets and SMS, for example. Of course, video footage, pictures and satellite imagery can also provide important information, but we&#8217;re more interested in text-based data for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first point to note is that information can range from being very structured to highly unstructured. The word structure is simply another way of describing how organized information is. A few examples are in order vis-a-vis text-based information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book is generally highly structured information. Why? Well, because the author hopefully used page numbers, chapter headings, paragraphs, punctuation, an index and table of contents. The fact that the book is structured makes it easier for the reader to find the information she is looking for. The other end of the &#8220;structure spectrum&#8221; would be a run-on sentence with nospacesandpunctuation. Not terribly helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below is a slide from a seminar I taught on disaster and conflict early warning back in 2006; ignore the (c).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/ewstructure.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1740" title="ewstructure" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/ewstructure.png?w=500&#038;h=448" alt="ewstructure" width="500" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slide above depicts the tradeoff between control and structure. We can impose structure on data collected if we control the data entry process. Surveys are an example of a high-control process that yields high-structure. We want high structure because this allows us to find and analyze the data more easily (c.f. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">entropy</a>). This has generally been the preferred approach, particularly amongst academics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we give up control, as one does when crowdsourcing crisis information, we open ourselves up to the possibility of having to deal with a range of structured and unstructured information. To make sense of this information typically requires data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can identify structure in said information. For example, we would want to identify nouns, verbs, places and dates in order to extra event-data.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One way to do this would be to automatically tag an article with the parameters &#8220;who, what, where and when.&#8221; A number of platforms such as <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">Open Calais</a> and <a href="http://www.ca-c.org/online/2006/journal_eng/cac-03/10.linen.shtml">Virtual Research Associate&#8217;s FORECITE</a> already do this. However, these platforms are not customized for crowdsourcing of crisis information and most are entirely closed. (Note: I did consulting work for <a href="http://www.vranet.com/">VRA</a> many years ago).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we need to draw (and modify) relevant algorithms that are publically available and provide and a user-friendly interface for human oversight of the automated tagging (what we also referred to as crowdsourcing the filter). Here&#8217;s a proposed interface that Chris recently designed for Swift River.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/swiftriver.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1742" title="swiftriver" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/swiftriver.png?w=500&#038;h=312" alt="swiftriver" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea would be to develop an algorithm that parses the text (on the left) and auto-suggests answers for the tags (on the right). The user would then confirm or correct the suggested tags and the algorithm would learn from it&#8217;s mistakes. In other words, the algorithm would become more accurate over time and the need for human oversight would decrease. In short, we&#8217;d be developing a data-driven ontology backed up by <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> to provide semantic linkages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">VRA already does this but, (1) the data validation is carried out by one (poor) individual, (2) the articles were restricted to the headlines from <a href="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a> and Agence France Press (<a href="http://www.afp.com/afpcom/en">AFP</a>) newswires, and (3) the project did not draw on semantic analysis. The validation component entailed making sure that events described in the headlines were correctly coded by the parser and ensuring there were no duplicates. See VRA&#8217;s patent for the full methodology (<a href="../files/2009/05/vra-parser-patent.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Triangulation and Scoring</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above tagging process would yield a highly structured event dataset like the example depicted below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/dataset.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1743" title="dataset" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/dataset.png?w=500&#038;h=170" alt="dataset" width="500" height="170" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We could then use simple machine analysis to cluster the same events together and thereby do away with any duplicate event-data. The four records above would then be collapsed into one record:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/datafilter2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1757" title="datafilter2" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/datafilter2.png?w=500&#038;h=74" alt="datafilter2" width="500" height="74" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But that&#8217;s not all. We would use a simple weighting or scoring schema to assign a reality score to determine the probability that the event reported really happened. I already described this schema in my <a href="../2009/04/10/developing-swift-river-to-validate-crowdsourcing/">previous post</a> so will just give one example: An event that is reported by more than one source is more likely to have happened. This increases the reality score of the event above and pushes it higher up the list. One could also score an event by the geographical proximity of the source to the reported event, and so on. These scores could be combined to give an overall score.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Compelling Visualization</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The database output above is not exactly compelling to most people. This is where we need some creative visualization techniques to render the information more intuitive and interesting. Here are a few thoughts. We could draw on <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a> to visualize the triangulated event-data over time. We could also use the idea of a volume equalizer display.</p>
<p><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/equalize.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1746" title="equalize" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/equalize.png?w=500&#038;h=204" alt="equalize" width="500" height="204" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not the best equalizer interface around for sure, but hopefully gets the point across. Instead of decibels on the Y-axis, we&#8217;d have probability scores that an event really happened. Instead of frequencies on the X-axis, we&#8217;d have the individual events. Since the data coming in is not static, the bars would bounce up and down as more articles/tweets get tagged and dumped into the event database.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I think this would be an elegant way to visualize the data, not least because the animation would resemble the flow or waves of a swift river but the idea of using a volume equalizer could be used as analogy to quiet the unwanted noise. For the actual Swift River interface, I&#8217;d prefer using more colors to denote different characteristics about the event and would provide the user with the option of double-clicking on a bar to drill down to the event sources and underlying text.</p>

				<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;ve given many presentations on crisis mapping over the past two years but these were never filmed. So I decided to create <strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/4362515">this video presentation</a></strong> with narration in order to share my findings more widely and hopefully get a lot of feedback in the process. The presentation is not meant to be exhaustive although the video does run to about 30 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topics covered in this presentation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis Map Sourcing</strong> &#8211; information collection;</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Crisis Mapping</strong> &#8211; mobile technology;</li>
<li><strong>Crisis Mapping Visualization</strong> &#8211; data visualization;</li>
<li><strong>Crisis Mapping Analysis</strong> &#8211; spatial analysis.</li>
</ul>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;">There were a number of mapping-related papers, posters and demo’s at <a href="http://www.ictd2009.org/">ICTD2009</a>. One paper in particular caught my intention given the topic’s direct relevance to my ongoing consulting work with the UN’s Threat and Risk Mapping Analysis (<a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/threat-and-risk-mapping-analysis-in-sudan/">TRMA</a>) project in the Sudan and the upcoming <a href="http://earlywarning.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/an-ecosystem-approach-to-conflict-early-warningresponse/">ecosystem project</a> in Liberia with <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> and <a href="http://www.humanityunited.org/">Humanity United</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Entitled “Folksomaps – Towards Community Intelligent Maps for Developing Regions,” the paper outlines a community-driven approach for creating maps by drawing on “Web 2.0 principles” and “Semantic Web technologies” but without having to rely entirely on a web-based interface. Indeed, Folksomaps “makes use of web and voice applications to provide access to its services.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I particularly value the authors’ aim to “provide map-based services that represent user’s intuitive way of finding locations and directions in developing regions.” This is an approach that definitely resonates with me. Indeed, it is our responsibility to adapt and customize our community-based mapping tools to meet the needs, habits and symbology of the end user; not the other way around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I highly recommend this paper (or summary below) to anyone doing work in the crisis mapping field. In fact, I consider it required reading. The paper is co-authored by Arun Kumar, Dipanjan Chakraborty, Himanshu Chauhan, Sheetal Agarwal and Nitendra Rajput of <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/irl/">IBM India Research Lab</a> in New Delhi.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vast rural areas of developing countries do not have detailed maps or mapping tools. Rural populations are generally semi-literate, low-income and non-tech savvy. They are hardly like to have access to <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/neogeography-and-crisis-mapping-analytics/">neogeography</a> platforms like Google Earth. Moreover, the lack of electricity access and Internet connection also complicates the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also know that cities, towns and villages in developing countries “typically do not have well structured naming of streets, roads and houses,” which means “key landmarks become very important in specifying locations and directions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Drawing on these insights, the authors seek to tap the collective efforts of local communities to populate, maintain and access content for their own benefit—an approach I have <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/ushahidi-from-croudsourcing-to-crowdfeeding/">described as crowdfeeding</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Surveys of Tech and Non-Tech Users</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The study is centered on end-user needs, which is rather refreshing. The authors carried out a series of surveys to be better understand the profiles of end-users, e.g., tech and non-tech users.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first survey</strong> sought to identify answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do people find out points of interest?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do much people rely on maps versus people on the streets?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do people provide local information to other people?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whether people are interested in consuming and feeding information for a community-driven map system?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The results are listed in the table below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksotb1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1684" title="folksotb1" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksotb1.png?w=479&#038;h=228" alt="folksotb1" width="479" height="228" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Non-tech savvy users did not use maps to find information about locations and only 36% of these users required precise information. In addition, 75% of non-tech respondents preferred the choice of a phone-based interface, which really drives home the need for what I have coined “Mobile Crisis Mapping” or MCM.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tech-users also rely primarily on others (as opposed to maps) for location related information. The authors associate this result with the lack of signboards in countries like India. “Many a times, the maps do not contain fine-grained information in the first place.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most tech-users responded that a phone-based location and direction finding system in addition to a web-based interface. Almost 80% expressed interest in “contributing to the service by uploading content either over the phone or though a web-based portal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second survey </strong>sought to identify how tech and non-tech users express directions and local information. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you give directions to people on the road or to friends?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do you describe proximity of a landmark to another one?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do you describe distance? Kilometers or using time-to-travel?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The results are listed in the table below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksotb2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1685" title="folksotb2" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksotb2.png?w=500&#038;h=161" alt="folksotb2" width="500" height="161" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of non-tech savvy participants said they make use of landmarks when giving directions. “They use names of big roads […] and use ‘near to’, ‘adjacent to’, ‘opposite to’ relations with respect to visible and popular landmarks […].” Almost 40% of responders said they use time only to describe the distance between any two locations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tech-savvy participants almost always use both time and kilometers as a measure to represent distance. Only 10% or so of participants used kilometers only to represent distance.</p>
<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following characteristics highlight the design choices that differentiate Folksomaps from established notions of map systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relies on user generated content rather than data populated by professionals;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Strives for spatial integrity in the logical sense and does not consider spatial integrity in the physical sense as essential (which is a defining feature of <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/from-social-mapping-to-crisis-mapping/">social maps</a>);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does not consider visual representation as essential, which is important considering the fact that a large segment of users in developing countries do not have access to Internet (hence my own emphasis on mobile crisis mapping);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is non-static and intelligent in the sense that it infers new information from what is entered by the users.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>User input is not verified by the system and it is possible that pieces of incorrect information in the knowledgebase may be present at different points of time. Folksomaps adopts the Wiki model and allows all users to add, edit and remove content freely while keeping maps up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Conceptual Design</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Folksomaps uses “landmark” as the basic unit in the mapping knowledgebase model while “location” represents more coarse-grained geographical areas such as a village, city or country. The model then seeks to capture a few key logical characteristics of locations such as direction, distance, proximity and reachability and layer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The latter constitutes the granularity of the geographic area that a location represents. “The notion of direction and distance from a location is interpreted with respect to the layer that the location represents. In other words, direction and distance could be viewed as binary operator over locations of the same level. For instance, ‘is towards left of ’ would be appropriate if the location pair being considered is &lt;Libya, Egypt&gt;,” but not if the pair is &lt;Nairobi, India&gt;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The knowledgebase makes use of two modules, the Web Ontology Language (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL</a>) and a graph database, to represent and store the above concepts. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a> language OWL is used to model the categorical characteristics of a landmark (e.g., direction, proximity, etc), and thence infer new relationships not explicitly specified by users of the system. In other words, OWL provides an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a> of locations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The graph database is used represent distance (numerical relationships) between landmarks. “The locations are represented by nodes and the edges between two nodes of the graph are labeled with the distance between the corresponding locations.” Given the insights gained from user surveys, precise distances and directions are not integral components of community-based maps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two modules are used to generate answers to queries submitted by users.</p>
<h3>User Interaction</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authors rightly recognize that the user interface design is critical to the success of community-based mapping projects. To be sure, users of may be illiterate, or semi-illiterate and not very tech-savvy. Furthermore, users will tend to query the map system when they need it most, e.g., “when they are stuck on the road looking for directions […] and would be pressed for time.” This very much holds true for crisis mapping as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Users can perform three main tasks with the system: “find place”, “trace path” and “add info.” In addition, some or all users may be granted the right to edit or remove entries from the knowledgebase. The Folksomaps system can also be bootstrapped from existing databases to populate instances of location types. “Two such sources of data in the absence of a full-fledged Geographical Information System (GIS) come from the Telecom Industry and the Postal Department.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksofig3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1686" title="folksofig3" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksofig3.png?w=500&#038;h=349" alt="folksofig3" width="500" height="349" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How the users interface with the system to carry out these tasks will depend on how tech-savvy or literate they are and what type of access they have to information and communication technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Folksomaps thus provides three types of interface: web-based, voice-based and SMS-based. Each interface allows the user to query and update the database. The web-based interface was developed using Java Server Pages (JSP) while the voice-based interface uses JSPs and VoiceXML.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksofig41.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1688" title="folksofig41" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksofig41.png?w=500&#038;h=368" alt="folksofig41" width="500" height="368" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am particularly interested in the voice-based interface. The authors point to previous studies that suggest a voice-based interaction works well with users who are illiterate or semi-illiterate and who cannot afford to have high-end devices but can use ordinary low-end phones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksofig1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1689" title="folksofig1" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksofig1.png?w=500&#038;h=210" alt="folksofig1" width="500" height="210" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will share this with the <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> development team with the hopes that they will consider adding a voice-based interface for the platform later this year. To be sure, could be very interesting to integrate <a href="http://www.kubatana.net/html/ff/ff_cont.asp">Freedom Fone&#8217;s work</a> in this area.</p>
<h3>Insights from User Studies</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authors conducted user studies to verify the benefit and acceptability of Folksomaps. Tech-savvy used the web-based interface while non-tech savvy participants used the voice-based interface. The results are shown in the two tables below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksotb3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1690" title="folksotb3" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folksotb3.png?w=500&#038;h=228" alt="folksotb3" width="500" height="228" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Several important insights </strong>surfaced from the results of the user studies. For example, an important insight gained from the non-tech user feedback was “the sense of security that they would get with such a system. […] Even though asking for travel directions from strangers on the street is an option, it exposes the enquirer to criminal elements […].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another insight gain was the fact that many non-tech savvy participants were willing to pay for the call even a small premium over normal charges as they saw value to having this information available to them at all times.” That said, the majority of participants “preferred the advertisement model where an advertisement played in the beginning of the call pays for the entire call.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Interestingly, almost all participants preferred the voice-based interface over SMS even though the former led to a number of speech recognition errors. The reason being that “many people are either not comfortable using SMS or not comfortable using a mobile phone itself.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were also interesting insights on the issue of accuracy from the perspective of non-tech savvy participants. Most participants asked for full accuracy and only a handful were tolerant of minor mistakes. “In fact, one of the main reasons for preferring a voice call over asking people for directions was to avoid wrong directions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This need for high accuracy is driven by the fact that most people use public transportation, walk or use a bicycle to reach their destination, which means the cost of incorrect information is large compared to someone who owns a car.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important insight since the authors had first assumed that tolerance for incorrect information was higher. They also learned that meta information is as important to non-tech savvy users as the landmarks themselves. For instance, low-income participants were more interested in knowing the modes of available transportation, timetables and bus route numbers than the road route from a source to a destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folkstb4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1691" title="folkstb4" src="http://irevolution.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/folkstb4.png?w=478&#038;h=237" alt="folkstb4" width="478" height="237" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In terms of insights from tech-savvy participants, they did not ask for fine-grained directions all the time. “They were fight with getting high level directions involving major landmarks.” In addition, the need for accuracy was not as strong as for the non-tech savvy respondents and they preferred the content from the queries sent to them via SMS so they could store it for future access, “pointing out that it is easy to forget the directions if you just hear it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some tech-savvy participants also suggested that the directions provided by Folksomaps should “take into consideration the amount of knowledge the subject already has about the area, i.e., it should be personalized based upon user profile. Other participants mentioned that “frequent changes in road plans due to constructions should be captured by such a system—thus making it more usable than just getting directions.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In sum, the user interface of Folksomaps needs to be “rich and adaptive to the information needs of the user […].” To be sure, given user preference towards “voice-based interface over SMS, designing an efficient user-friendly voice-based user interface […].” In addition, “dynamic and real-time information augmented with traditional services like finding directions and locations would certainly add value to Folksomaps.” Furthermore, the authors recognize that Folksomaps can “certainly benefit from user interface designs,” and “multi-model front ends.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the user surveys suggest “the community is very receptive towards the concept of a community-driven map,” so it is important that the <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/threat-and-risk-mapping-analysis-in-sudan/">TRMA</a> project in the Sudan and the <a href="http://earlywarning.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/an-ecosystem-approach-to-conflict-early-warningresponse/">ecosystem</a> Liberia project build on the insights and lessons learned provided in this study.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/04/09/explaining-swift-river/">Swift River</a> is an <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> initiative to crowdsource the process of data validation. We’re developing a Swift River pilot to complement the <a href="http://www.votereport.in/">VoteReport India</a> crowdsourcing platform we officially launched this week. As part of the Swift River team, I&#8217;d like to share with <em>iRevolution</em> readers what I hope the Swift River tool will achieve.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We had an excellent series of <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/03/21/ushahidi-strategy-tech-meeting-in-orlando/">brainstorming sessions</a> several weeks ago in Orlando and decided we would combine both natural language processing (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLP">NLP</a>) and decentralized human filtering to get one step closer at validating crowdsourced data. Let me expand on how I see both components working individually and together.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Automated Parsing</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Double-counting has typically been the bane of traditional NLP or automated event-data extraction algorithms. At Virtual Research Associates (<a href="http://www.vranet.com/">VRA</a>), for example, we would parse headlines of Reuters newswires in quasi real-time, which meant that a breaking story would typically be updated throughout the day or week.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the natural language parser was specifically developed to automate event-data extraction based on the parameters &#8220;Who did what, to whom, where and when?&#8221; In other words, the parser could not distinguish whether coded events were actually the same or related. This tedious task was left to VRA analysts to carry out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Digital Straw</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The logic behind eliminating double counting (duplicate event-data) is inevitably reversed given the nature of crowdsourcing. To be sure, the more reports are collected about a specific event, the more likely it is that the event in question actually took place as described by the crowd. Ironically, that is precisely why we want to “drink from the fire hose,” the swift river of data gushing through the wires of social media networks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We simply need a clever digital straw to filter the torrent of data. This is where our Swift River project comes in and why I first addressed the issue of double counting. One of the central tasks I’d like Swift River to do is to parse the incoming reports from VoteReport India and to cluster them into unique event-clusters. This would be one way to filter the cascading data. Moreover, the parser could potentially help filter fabricated reports.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">An Example</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if 17 individual reports from different sources are submitted over a two-day period about “forged votes,” then the reports in effect self-triangulate or validate each other. Of course, someone (with too much time on their hands) might decide to send 17 false reports about “forged votes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our digital straw won’t filter all the impurities, but automating this first-level filter is surely better than nothing. Automating this process would require that the digital straw automate the extraction of nouns, verbs and place names from each report, i.e., actor, action and location. Date and time would automatically be coded based on when the report was submitted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reports that use similar verbs (synonyms) and refer to the same or similar actors at the same location on the same day can then be clustered into appropriate event-clusters. More on that in the section on crowdsourcing the filter below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">More Filters</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A second-level filter would compare the content of the reports to determine if they were exact replicas. In other words, if someone were simply copying and pasting the same report, Swift River could flag those identical reports as suspicious. This means someone gaming the system would have to send multiple reports with different wording, thus making it a bit more time consuming to game the system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third-level filter or trip-wire could compare the source of the 17 reports. For example, perhaps 10 reports were submitted by email, 5 by SMS and two by Twitter. The greater the diversity of media used to report an event, the more likely that event actually happened. This means that someone wanting to game the system would have to send several emails, text messages and Tweets using different language to describe a particular event.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A fourth-level filter could identify the email addresses, IP addresses and mobile phone numbers in question to determine if they too were different. A crook trying to game the system would now have to send emails from different accounts and IP addresses, different mobile phone numbers, and so on. Anything “looking suspicious” would be flagged for a human to review; more on that soon. The point is to make the gaming of the system as time consuming and frustrating as possible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Gaming the System</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, if someone is absolutely bent on submitting fabricated data that passes all the filters, then they will.  But those individuals probably constitute a minority of offenders. Perhaps the longer and more often they do this, the more likely someone in the crowd will pick up on the con. As for the less die-hard crooks out there, they may try and game the system only to see that their reports do not get mapped. Hopefully they&#8217;ll give up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I do realize I&#8217;m giving away some &#8220;secrets&#8221; to gaming the system, but I hope this will be more a deterrent than an invitation to crack the system. If you do happen to be someone bent on gaming the platform, I wish you&#8217;d get in touch with us instead and help us improve the filters. Either way, we&#8217;ll learn from you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one on the Swift River team claims that 100% of the dirt will be filtered. What we seek to do is develop a digital filter that makes the data that does come through palatable enough for public consumption.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Crowdsourcing the Filter</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember the unique event-clusters idea from above? These could be visualized in a simple and intuitive manner for human volunteers (the crowd) to filter. Flag icons, perhaps using three different colors—green, orange and red—could indicate how suspicious a specific series of reports might be based on the results of the individual filters described above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A green flag would indicate that the report has been automatically mapped on VoteReport upon receipt. An orange flag would indicate the need for review by the crowd while a red flag would send an alert for immediate review.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a member of the crowd does confirm that a series of reports were indeed fabricated, Swift River would note the associated email address(es), IP address(es) and/or mobile phone number(s) and automatically flag future reports from those sources as red. In other words, Swift River would start rating the credibility of users as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we can pull this off, Swift River may actually start to provide &#8220;early warning&#8221; signals. To be sure, if we fine tune our unique event-cluster approach, a new event-cluster would be created by a report that describes an event which our parser determines has not yet been reported on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should set off a (yellow) flag for immediate review by the crowd. This could either be a legitimate new event or a fabricated report that doesn&#8217;t fit into pre-existing cluster. Of course, we will get a number of false positives, but that&#8217;s precisely why we include the human crowdsourcing element.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Simplicity</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either way, as the Swift River team has already agreed, this process of crowdsourcing the filter needs to be rendered as simple and seamless as possible. This means minimizing the number of clicks and “mouse motions” a user has to make and allowing for short-cut keys to be used, just like in Gmail. In addition, a userfiendly version of the interface should be designed specifically for mobile phones (various platforms and brands).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As always, I&#8217;d love to get your feedback.</p>
