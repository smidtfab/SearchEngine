<p>Professional translations can be a tricky thing. Certainly a business can&#8217;t simply go to a tool that uses only machine translation and hope to get a high quality, accurate, and professional product. Instead, they reach out to services that offer professional translations. However, it may be difficult to find one that can perform fast and be affordable all the while giving you a high quality product. Luckily, advancements in the field have made translation easier.</p>
<p>Now it easier, faster, and more affordable than ever to get the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.speaklike.com');"  href="http://www.speaklike.com" target="_blank">professional translation</a> you need. And I&#8217;m not talking about from a website that uses only machine translations and no human input.</p>
<p>Here are three helpful translation tools that use both human services and technology to produce the best translations you can get. Anyone with professional translation needs can take advantage of these services. It&#8217;s translation made easy!</p>
<p>Imagine that you need to e-mail an important document to an overseas client, let&#8217;s say into Germany. However, the document needs to be translated in German. Well now that translation has been made easy you can do that without wasting time. There are services out there that will <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.speaklike.com/products/email');"  href="http://www.speaklike.com/products/email" target="_blank">translate e-mails</a> for you and send them to your client once done, and it&#8217;s fast!</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s world is a busy one. You can&#8217;t always be in the comfort of your office, sometimes you need to be on the move. What if this happens and you need a translation? No problem, all you need is a smart phone. Getting professional translations no longer requires you to be sitting in front of a computer, now you can <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.speaklike.com/products/mobile');"  href="http://www.speaklike.com/products/mobile" target="_blank">get translations on the go</a>!</p>
<p>Social media can play a big part in any businesses attempt to land customers. It&#8217;s essentially free advertising. But why only advertise to people in one language? Now it can be done easily over <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.speaklike.com/products/twitter');"  href="http://www.speaklike.com/products/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter in multiple languages</a>. Twitter has become a powerful tool for reaching out to customers and with the option to tweet in multiple languages the potential of the social media tool grows exponentially.</p>
<p>So if you are a business that needs help when it comes to getting fast, affordable, and high quality translations then these tools are what you are looking for.</p>

Sure, you can seek a professional translator or two to do it for you. This, of course, will be expensive and time consuming.

<p>On-demand gives you professional, fast, and high quality translations for a fraction of the cost and time than any other method. It uses technology to better suit your needs.</p>

<p>If you are looking for information about on-demand translation services then take a deep breath and relax because this is the article you have been looking for.</p>
<p>In this article we will look at three main points of on-demand translation services. First we will look at what on-demand translation services are. Next, we will explore how they are used to help companies. Last, but certainly not least, we will touch on the advantages of on-demand translation services.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what on-demand translation services are.</p>
<p>The translation business has evolved greatly over time and now it is easier and quicker than ever to get translations for your company. The greatest advancement in the field has been the development of on-demand translation services. On-demand translation is made up of technologies that combine the best aspects of prior translation services and methods. It combines the efficiency and cost of crowd-sourcing translation with the quality and service level assurance that traditional translation offers.</p>
<p>On-demand services let you automate your translation needs while being confident that they are done quickly, efficiently, and correctly.</p>
<p>Next, lets venture over to why a company should use on-demand translation services.</p>
<p>Every company wants to find a way to get more done in a short amount of time and at a lower cost. Well this is exactly what on-demand translation can do for you. It enables you to automate many of your translating needs. What this does is free up time and save you money. This is because you no longer need to exhaust resources to translate what you need and no longer need to pay professional translators to do it for you. Since it is quick and efficient the company can focus on other important tasks all while knowing that their translation needs are being taken care of.</p>
<p>So if you have translation needs, on-demand is the way to go. It allows you to save time and money by automating the translation process. It is also fast and allows you to submit new material as you obtain it.</p>
<p>Finally, let us touch on the advantages of on-demand translation services.</p>
<p>Of course any company wants any service they use to be affordable and even save them money. Well that is what on-demand translation services can do for you. A provider of this service, Speaklike.com, has said that customers report up to 50% time and cost savings as a result of automating their localization process. Again it ties into the on-demand service allowing you to automate the service it provides you with, freeing up resources to use on other important matters.</p>
<p>The quickness, efficiency, time saving, and money saving are the advantages of using on-demand translation services as opposed to let&#8217;s say traditional translation.</p>
<p>Now you know the three reasons to use on-demand translation services. You know what it is, why you should use it, and how it can save you time and money. Taking the step to use on-demand translation services should now be much easier for you now!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<div class="tweetmeme_button" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><iframe src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/button.js?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.testing.lunchbreakvids.com%2F2010%2F09%2Fthe-truth-about-crowdsourcing%2F&amp;style=normal&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If you are looking for information on what exactly crowdsourcing is then you&#8217;ve come to the right place. In this post I am going to look at what crowdsourcing is. Next, I will talk about why it is an important tool. Finally, I&#8217;m going to show what companies use it for.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about what crowdsourcing is.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is basically using the public to help you with business problems and input. Instead of outsourcing and spending tons of time on a problem you simply look to the public for their advice and thoughts on how to fix a problem. For instance a website that reviews movies might let the users of the site be the reviewers instead of hiring people to write the reviews. This helps portray what the general public actually thinks of the movie and saves the site money!</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s talk about why crowdsourcing is an important tool.</p>
<p>Suppose that you ran the review website I mentioned above. Sure you could hire professional writers to review the movies, but that would cost you money. Now imagine you just let users of the site write their own reviews on the movies. This wouldn&#8217;t cost you anything and at the same time make the users feel a more personal connection to the site. It is a classic example of getting customer input and at the same time building your site!</p>
<p>With the Internet crowdsourcing is easier than ever because you can connect thousands of people to complete basic tasks that are needed for your business  for little to no cost. It also saves time so that you and your staff can focus on more important things like bettering the SEO of the website. Also it lets you get customer feedback quickly and cheaply. At the same time it gives the customer the feeling that he has helped you in a personal way, and many times the feedback does.</p>
<p>Finally, let&#8217;s look at how some companies use crowdsourcing to their advantage.</p>
<p>Many big businesses and small businesses alike use crowdsourcing. They use it because it is cheap and effective. For instance, Threadless.com lets users submit designs for t-shirts, let&#8217;s users vote on the designs, and based on those votes they choose which shirts to make. By crowdsourcing they eliminated needing a team of designers, choosing instead to let the people choose what they want to be made. Speaklike.com also uses crowdsourcing to help its customers get translations in a quick and efficient matter. By integrating crowdsourcing and translation software it helps businesses save time and money on their translation needs.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is a helpful tool whether you are a small or big business.</p>
<p>So there you go, those are the essentials of crowdsourcing and why it is important. First, what exactly is crowdsourcing. Next, why it is important. Finally, how some examples of how companies use it to help themselves and their customers. Now you are ready to use crowdsourcing to help yourself!</p>
