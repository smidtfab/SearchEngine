<h3>The Rook Endgame Machine of Torres y Quevedo</h3>
<h4>By Ram�n Jim�nez</h4>
<p>Chess, it seems to be, has always been fascinating to people wishing to create 
  machines that behave like humans, or at least the illusion thereof. Baron Wolfgang 
  von Kempelen created his famous Chess Turk back in 1769, and many others after 
  him tried to repeat the awe-inspiring trick by creating similar devices, most 
  notably Charles Hopper's <em>Ajeeb</em>, also known as �The Egyptian�, 
  which during its exhibitions at Coney Island in the United States during the 
  1894-1904 period is said to have been operated by none other than Harry Pillsbury 
  himself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In any event, for a long number of years mankind seriously thought that a 
  machine that could play chess would be truly intelligent. And so, entertainers 
  like Von Kempelen and Hopper notwithstanding, many brilliant minds devoted 
  themselves to the creation of such a machine. One would think the first steps 
  in this direction were simply impossible without our modern, digital computers, 
  but one of Spain's most famous engineers of all times knew better.</p>

        Torres y Quevedo</strong>, born on December 28, 1852 in Santa Cruz, Spain, 
        graduated from the Institute of Bilbao, studied in Paris, graduated from 
        the Madrid School of Engineering. After inheriting a fortune from his 
        aunts he gave up a railway job, married and had eight children. He then 
        devoted himself to mechanical inventions (patenting a safer funicular 
        cable-car design) and mathematical studies (in 1894 Torres built an algebraic 
        equation solver). In the first years of the 20th century he built Spain's 
        first dirigible, designed a transatlantic airship, patented a wireless 
        "Telekino", designed the "Aero Car" at Niagara Falls 
        (which is still in operation today). In 1910 he became the President 
        of Royal Academy of Exact Sciences in Madrid. His "Ensayos sobre 
        autom�tica" describes the electromechanical implementation 
        of Babbage's Analytic Engine. Torres died in Madrid on December 18, 1936.</p>

<p><img src="images2/2004/torres04.jpg" width="210" height="290" hspace="6" align="right">In 
  1912 Torres built his chess machine 'Ajedrecista', using electromagnets under 
  the board to play the endgame rook and king against the lone king. Well, not 
  precisely play. But the machine could, in a totally unassisted and automated 
  fashion, deliver mate with King and Rook against King. This was possible regardless 
  of the initial position of the pieces on the board. For the sake of simplicity, 
  the algorithm used to calculate the positions didn't always deliver mate in 
  the minimum amount of moves possible, but it did mate the opponent flawlessly 
  every time.</p>
<p>The machine, dubbed El Ajedrecista (Spanish for �the chessplayer�), 
  was built in 1912 and made its public debut during the Paris World Fair of 
  1914, creating great excitement at the time. It used a mechanical arm to make 
  its moves and electrical sensors to detect its opponent's replies. </p>
<p>In 1920 a second automaton (attributed by some sources to Leonardo's son, 
  Gonzalo), was built that made its plays via magnets located under the board. 
  Both machines still work and are on display at the Colegio de Ingenieros de 
  Caminos, Canales y Puertos in Madrid.</p>

  <em>Gonzalo Torres y Quevedo</em><em>showing his rook endgame machine to Norbert 
  Weiner</em></p>
<p>It may be said that a King and Rook versus King endgame is very simple. By 
  today's engineering standards, the mechanical automatons built by Torres y 
  Quevedo are not precisely earth-shattering. However, they were in their day, 
  more than 90 years ago; and more so considering computers were nowhere near 
  inception. And in fact, because of this and other important contributions, 
  Torres y Quevedo's works are regarded today as major precursors to artificial 
  intelligence and modern computing. And this despite the fact that, due to adverse 
  circumstances, his ideas didn't influence the trade as much as they could have.</p>
