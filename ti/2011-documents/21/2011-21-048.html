<div class="seealso">
 <b>See also </b> the <a href="/support/podcast-transcription-faq.html">podcast subscription</a> FAQ, and the <a href="/support/terms-of-service.html">terms of service</a> page.
 </div>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<dl>
<dt><a name="tos"></a>What is your guarantee policy for 1-day and 6-day orders?</dt>
 <dd>
The money-back guarantee applies to high-quality audio only. Please read our <a href="/support/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> for complete details. Also, check out the FAQ on <a href="#difficultquality">difficult audio</a> as well for more information on what makes audio difficult.
 </dd>

 <dt><a name="pricing"></a>Is the price really per minute of audio?</dt>
 <dd>
Yes. We price on the length of the audio we receive - not the amount of time it takes to complete the transcript.  Please keep in mind that we differentiate price-wise between good and bad quality audio. See <a href="#quality">What quality of audio does CastingWords accept?</a> for more details.
 </dd>

 <dt><a name="turnaround"></a>What influences turnaround?</dt>
 <dd>
Many things. If you need a file transcribed quickly use our 1- or 6-Day services. We also offer a &quot;difficult audio&quot; option which speeds up turnaround as well.
<br/>
The biggest influence here is <a href="#quality">audio quality</a>. Even if your audio meets our minimum quality standards, lesser quality audio still takes longer to transcribe than better quality. Audio with heavy accents, background noise, and/or highly obscure or technical content usually takes more time to transcribe and edit than crisp, clear audio. Long files, of course, generally take more time than short ones. Once files reach the 2 hour-plus mark, turnaround slows dramatically. 
 </dd>


 <dt><a name="formats"></a>What format are the finished transcripts delivered in?</dt>
 <dd>
   The finished transcriptions are delivered in plain text, HTML and RTF. RTF is a Microsoft Word friendly format.  If you have the URL for a transcript  change the file extension (e.g., .txt) at the end to download the other formats.
 </dd>


  <dt><a name="notes"></a>What is the notes box for?</dt>
  <dd>
It's a way for you to communicate with both CastingWords and the transcriptionist. The box may be used, for example, to list the names of podcast speakers, or to point out potentially tricky technical terms, acronyms, or spellings of words. It is helpful to include a link to the site of the original podcast, audio file, and/or relevant websites. Also, please include notes on anything in the audio file that does NOT need to be included in the transcript (please note if you DO want commercial breaks transcribed). Keep in mind that the quality of the notes included will directly affect the quality of the final transcript. A good set of notes can substantially reduce the time it will take you to edit the transcription once you receive it.

</dd>




  <dt><a name="accounts"></a>Why get an account?</dt>
  <dd>
A CastingWords account is not required for orders, and does not save your credit card information.  Accounts do allow you to check up on order status, retrieve completed transcripts, and set up transcriptionist notes for all of your orders.
</dd>




  <dt><a name="ads"></a>Does CastingWords skip the ads in the audio file?</dt>

  <dd>Yes. Our policy is that all breaks from programs are to be noted but not transcribed. This includes ads, promos and songs.
<br/>
If you want that content transcribed, please detail that it in the note box for our transcriptionists.
</dd>

  <dt><a name="speakers"></a>How many speakers are too many?</dt>

  <dd>With each additional speaker the chances of mislabeled
speakers increases. In addition, changes in speaker may not be
identified with larger numbers of speakers, or speakers with
similar voices. If you don't need to distinguish between every speaker, but want to use something that is more inclusive (such as Moderator and Panelist), please include this in the notes. This helps speed up editing quite a bit.

    <br><br>
We generally accept audio files with large numbers of speakers - but set lower
standards on the resulting transcript quality, especially if speakers tend to talk over one another. As a general rule,
transcripts with 3 or less speakers -- or with one main
speaker and some &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; are of good quality. 
Other transcripts may require significant editing on your
part.</dd>

  <dt><a name="quality"></a>What quality of
audio does CastingWords accept?</dt>

<dd>Audio quality affects transcript quality. We need audio sampled at least 44.1 kHz, with adequate volume, and very limited background noise, to produce transcripts of a reasonable quality. We may turn down work if we feel the audio quality is poor. We don't currently offer audio engineering services to improve audio quality.
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="difficultquality"></a>What is meant by difficult audio quality?</dt>
  <dd><p>Difficult audio is audio that is harder to transcribe. Some factors that might make audio difficult include: noise (background, foreground, etc.), speakers talking over each other, many speakers, specialized terminology (including technical, legal, scientific, and medical), muffled or quiet recordings, talking fast, and accents. If more than one of these characteristics are present in your audio, it most likely is difficult audio. This is not a comprehensive list but covers most cases.</p>

<p>Recordings in public places (cafes, restaurants, etc) are almost always difficult audio. Phone calls and focus groups are often difficult audio quality. </p>

<p>1-day transcription, 6-day transcription, and podcast subscription are meant for high quality audio. Podcast subscriptions must have high quality audio or we will return your order. 1-day and 6-day orders can be placed if you pay for difficult audio. We will get your transcript back to you as quickly as possible, but we do not guarantee turnaround. It all depends on just how difficult the audio is - most of the time it gets done close to the timeframe. <p>


<p>If we can't handle the audio quality we will notify you and refund your order less our costs up to that point. Sometimes it costs us more than you paid, so in some instances there will be no refund. You can also get a partial transcript instead of getting a refund.</p>

<p>You can add on difficult quality audio with any of our products. We don't guarantee turnaround times with difficult audio as stated before. However, the more you pay, the more we pay our transcribers which gives them incentive to work on difficult audio transcripts. </p>
  </dd>

 <dt><a name="timestamps"></a>When are timestamps placed?</dt>  
  <dd>Timestamps are inserted at the beginning of each speaker change, and if appropriate, for instance in audio files with long monologues, at paragraph breaks.

  </dd>






  <dt><a name="feedtypes"></a>What feed types does CastingWords handle?</dt>

  <dd>Currently we only accept RSS 2.0 feeds with enclosures, or direct links to audio files. In the future we may handle other feed types. Please send any additional feature requests to <a href="mailto:support@castingwords.com?subject=Feature Request">support@castingwords.com</a> if this is an issue for you.</dd>

  <dt><a name="filetypes"></a>What file types does CastingWords accept?</dt>

  <dd><p>We handle MP3, MP4, and WAV, and most WMA/WMV files at this time. We usually can handle other types of audio and video but your order might take longer to process (including 1- and 6-day orders). See the next question for how to convert other file types into MP3 format.
</p>
<p>We can NOT handle some proprietary formats.  These include:    </p>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style: square inside;  padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" ><b>WebEx ARF files</b>  - WebEx does make an tool available to some of it's customers that will allow exports to WMA.  If you can get a WMA exported we can transcribe that. 
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: square inside;  padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>DVF files</b> - Usually from Sony audio recorders.  Most of these recorders come with software that will export to MP3 or WAV files.    
</li></ul>
    
<p>We can NOT handle most streaming files at this time - these include Flash videos, and RealAudio Streams (.ram  files and rtmp:// urls) and Windows Media streams (.wax, .wvx, or .asx  files).  The exceptions are videos hosted on YouTube, Vimeo, and a few other very popular video streaming sites.</p>

    
    
</dd>








  <dt><a name="videocontent"></a>Does CastingWords transcribe onscreen content in video?</dt>

<dd>
At this time we do NOT transcribe, or otherwise use on-screen content in our transcripts.  Our process uses a number of tools to make our transcribers more efficient, and at this time those tools require an MP3 file.  As such all incoming audio or video is transcoded to MP3s, and our transcribers will not even see the video portion of your file. Customer demand is the main driver of when we implement this service - so if this is a requirement for you please write!
</dd>














 <dt><a name="downloads"></a>Do you accept downloads from third-party file sites such as YouSendIt?</dt>

  <dd>No. We do not accept orders where we have to manually download the file from another website. The URLs you order with should lead directly to the audio file. If you aren't sure if the URL goes to an audio file directly, you can test using your web browser. Download the URL in your browser (usually this option is available if you right-click on the link, or control click on a Mac). If the file is successfully downloaded, then the link should work fine for us.
</dd>
<dt><a name="convert"></a>How do I convert my audio file into MP3?</dt>

<dd>WAV to MP3 on Windows or Mac using iTunes:

<p>If you have a WAV file, you can easily convert it to MP3 using iTunes. Open it up in iTunes, then right-click (control click on the Mac) on the file. Choose &quot;Convert Selection to MP3&quot; in the Advanced Menu. To figure out where iTunes saved the new MP3, choose File - >Get Info, then look at the Where section at the bottom of the Summary tab. </p>

<p>If you don't see the option to Convert Selection to MP3, you probably need to alter your Import Settings in your iTunes Preferences to &quot;MP3 Encoder&quot;.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><a name="ftp"></a>Can I use FTP?</dt>

<dd>We now offer FTP to registered users. If you have not already, please <a href="//customer/login?just_create=1">sign up for an account</a> with us. After that, upload your files to <a href="ftp://castingwords.com">ftp://castingwords.com</a>, using your email and password to login, just as you would at our site. Most FTP clients ask for a &quot;username&quot;. Once your upload is completed go to <a href="//customer/my_uploads">My Uploads</a> to view, manage, and create orders from your uploads.

  <dt><a name="notifications"></a>What kinds of notifications will I receive?</dt>

  <dd>We always email you. We prefer to use the email
supplied with the audio file, but under certain circumstances we use the email associated with your payment method (i.e., PayPal or Google Checkout). Be aware as well that sometimes email does not successfully make it through to your mail server. It might get marked as spam or be turned away by your mail server. You can always log in to our website to download your transcripts and we encourage you to do that especially if you have ordered 1- or 6-day transcriptions. 
    <br><br>

We also supply you with an RSS feed for your order, which tracks its progress through the system.
    <br><br>

Finally we provide you with a 'podcastable' RSS feed of all of 
the transcriptions we have done for you along with their associated
audio.

  <dt><a name="payment"></a>What kinds of payment does CastingWords accept?</dt>

  <dd>CastingWords uses PayPal and Google Checkout for payments. If you do not already have one of these types of accounts you may pay using Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express on our PayPal and Google Checkout payment pages. 


</dd>

  <dt><a name="hiring"></a>Are you hiring?</dt>
  
  <dd>Yes, we are always looking for freelance transcribers and editors. This page explains how to work for us: <a href="http://turkers.castingwords.com/tutorials/getting_started.html">How to Work for CastingWords</a>. Below is a brief overview of how we get our transcription done.
<p>    We use Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform for our transcription. It's easy to become a transcriptionist. Visit <a href="http://mturk.com">mturk.com</a> and sign up for an account. You don't need to have an Amazon account already because when you sign up one will be created for you.
</p>
<p>The next step is for you to take our qualification test. Click on the Qualifications tab at the top of MTurk's website (after logging in) and then find "CastingWords PPT". Click on "Take the Qualification test" and follow the instructions. We don't actually test your transcription skill, instead we automatically start everyone off at the same score of 80. As you transcribe for us your score will increase, and you will be able to work on higher paying transcription tasks.
</p>
<p>When we send transcriptions to MTurk they will appear in the "HITs Available to You" area. Find the CastingWords HIT, click on "View a HIT in this group" and, if you'd like to do the transcription, click Accept.

  <dt><a name="cshours"></a>What are your customer support hours?</dt>


  
  <dd>


<p>We handle customer support inquiries between 10 am and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, U.S. Mountain Time. We only provide email support.</p>

<p>We do not answer very many emails on the weekends. We do check our email to make sure there is nothing time-critical (e.g., someone did not receive their one-day transcription on Friday.) We are a very small company and with limited resources which is why we do not offer phone support. We we try to have responsive email support and have a goal of responding to all requests within 1 business day.</p> </dd>


  <dt><a name="refund"></a>What is your refund policy?</dt>  
  <dd>


<p>If you cancel your order, we refund less our costs incurred. Be aware that sometimes our transcribers may be actively working on your transcript when you request to cancel. We do not have a way to tell them to stop working - we can only prevent future work from going out. We also need some time to read your email which for refunds we will use the costs within 4 business hours of your email. </p>
<p>
If you want the partial transcript then we don't send a refund and send you what we have so far. This usually only happens in the case of difficult audio that takes too long to complete. If you have difficult audio and do not pay for difficult audio then be aware that we might not send you a refund at all as our costs might be greater than what you paid for the order.</p>

  <dt><a name="crowd"></a>What does it mean that you crowdsource transcription?</dt>  
  <dd>
CastingWords uses crowdsourcing to produce transcripts. This means that work (transcription, grading, editing) is distributed to our workers over the Internet. Source material and intermediate work are posted temporarily on the web so workers can access it. 

<p></p>
</dd>



  <dt><a name="confidentiality"></a>Do you guarantee confidentiality/do you sign NDAs?</dt>
  <dd>


<p>No, we are not able to guarantee confidentiality at this time. Work is posted on a website and while we take every precaution to keep your transcript secure, we cannot guarantee anything.  We use a large pool of vetted contractors to do the work, and they understand that the work is confidential, and that they will never work for us again if they release it.  Additionally, due to our workflow most workers see just small sections of the transcript, making tracking and penalties easy to enforce. If you need absolute confidentiality, then do not use our service.

</p><p>We are considering adding this guarantee of confidentiality in the future using NDAs and a password-protected site to post jobs. We will make an announcement when this is available, but we do not have a date yet.</p>

  <dt><a name="upgrade"></a>Can I speed up my order or add things like timestamps?</dt>
  <dd>


<p>Yes. You can speed up the turnaround of your transcription order as well as add timestamps and/or difficlut audio to your order on our website. If you login to your account, and go to Order Status, you will see an Upgrade link next to open orders.
