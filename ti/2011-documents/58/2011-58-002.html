The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) workshop series encourages
research in information retrieval and related applications by
providing a large test collection, uniform scoring procedures,
and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their
results.  Now in its twentieth year, the conference has become
the major experimental effort in the field.  Participants in
the previous TREC conferences have examined a wide variety
of retrieval techniques and retrieval environments,
including cross-language retrieval, retrieval of web documents,
multimedia retrieval, and question answering.  Details about TREC
can be found at the TREC web site, <A HREF="http://trec.nist.gov">http://trec.nist.gov</A>.
</DT><BR><BR>

<DT>You are invited to participate in TREC 2011.  TREC 2011 will
consist of a set of tasks known as "tracks".  Each track focuses
on a particular subproblem or variant of the retrieval task as
described below.  Organizations may choose to participate in any or
all of the tracks.  Training and test materials are available from
NIST for some tracks; other tracks will use special collections that
are available from other organizations for a fee.
</DT><BR>
<DT>Dissemination of TREC work and results other than in the (publicly
available) conference proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of
participation specifically preclude any advertising claims based
on TREC results.  All retrieval results submitted to NIST are
published in the Proceedings and are archived on the TREC web site.
The workshop in November is open only to participating groups that
submit retrieval results for at least one track and to selected
government invitees.

<B><H3>Task Description</B></H3>

Below is a brief summary of the tasks.  Complete descriptions of
tasks performed in previous years are included in the Overview
papers in each of the TREC proceedings (in the Publications section
of the web site).<BR><BR>

The exact definition of the tasks to be performed in each track for
TREC 2011 is still being formulated.  Track discussion takes place
on the track mailing list.  To be added to a track mailing list,
follow the instructions for contacting that mailing list as
given below.  For questions about the track, send mail to the
track coordinator (or post the question to the track mailing list
once you join).<BR><BR>

TREC 2011 will contain eight tracks.  The Chemical IR,
Entity, Legal, Session, and Web tracks will continue from TREC 2010.
TREC 2011 will add tracks on microblogs, crowd sourcing, and
medical records.<BR><BR>







<B><H4><center>Chemical IR Track</B></H4></center>
The Chemical IR track addresses challenges in building
large chemical testbeds to evaluate, in a realistic scenario,
the state of the art in chemical information retrieval and
extraction tools.

<B><H4><center>Crowdsourcing Track</B></H4></center>

The Crowdsourcing track will investigate emerging crowd-based 
methods for search evaluation and/or developing hybrid automation+crowd 
search systems.

<B><H4><center>Entity Track</B></H4></center>
The overall aim of this track is to perform entity-oriented search tasks
in the World Wide Web.  These tasks are better answered by returning
specific objects instead of just any type document.

<B><H3>Conference Format</B></H3>
The conference itself will be used as a forum both for presentation
of results (including failure analyses and system comparisons),
and for more lengthy system presentations describing retrieval
techniques used, experiments run using the data, and other issues
of interest to researchers in information retrieval. 
All groups will be invited to present their results in a joint
poster session.  Some groups may also be selected to present
during plenary talk sessions.

<BR><BR>
<B><H3>Application Details</B></H3>
Organizations wishing to participate in TREC 2011 should respond
