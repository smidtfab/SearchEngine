<h1> Using Text to Predict The Real World </h1>

A panel at <a href="http://sxsw.com">SxSW 2011</a>, held
Sunday, March 13, 3:30 pm


<p>
How can we use text to tell us what is happening in the real world?
Text-driven forecasting is the challenge of making concrete, testable
predictions about future events and trends from publicly available
text data.  Text-based modeling methods make it possible to discover
the agendas and attitudes behind the words people use.  In this panel,
we consider some recent success stories that use various kinds of text
(expert-written analysis, blog posts, tweets) to tell us interesting
things about the future and about the people behind the texts in
various domains (finance, political discourse, and public opinion
polls).
