				<p>A quick investigation using Google discloses hundreds of companies providing logo design templates. The trademarks are inexpensive, speedy, and occasionally, may even be created in bunches. For the unaware business owner who does not have a qualified eye for high-quality style and design, the offer is appealing. The dilemma is, is it best to make the most of it?</p>
<p>It is easy enough to recognize why organizations offer the templates. It costs them virtually nothing at all to offer the service since the style and design process is almost entirely computerized. By charging a nominal amount, and attracting a high volume of purchases, they might make a healthy profit. Beneath the surface, however, it&#8217;s less a bargain than a lot of business owners understand.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll have a better glance at using low-cost templates for your corporation&#8217;s logo. We&#8217;ll concentrate on their drawbacks. You&#8217;ll find out that a $10 templated design may do more damage than good.</p>
<p>Employing A Template Kills Any Originality</p>
<p>Consider the objective of a template: it provides a design from which anything else is based. This is what Ford had in mind when he famously wrote in his autobiography, &#8220;Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.&#8221; </p>
<p>A template cannot be employed to generate a professional logo that is original and personalized for your company. Nor can it truly reflect your brand history or philosophy. Most templates are not capable of harvesting the essence of a particular industry, besides your company&#8217;s position in it.</p>
<p>Your logo should be original, a quality that can&#8217;t be developed from a template.</p>
<p>Templates Create A Homogenous Field Of Logo Design</p>
<p>With a templated logo, everything is predetermined. The visual elements are stock. The print styles are furthermore stock. In most instances, the identity of your business is merely dropped into the style and design with very little modification. There are a number of issues with this; all link to a lack of differentiation. </p>
<p>First, the symbols and other visual aspects that show up in your pre-made design and style also show up in the designs of additional trademarks. They are standardized. This is the only way the template companies could work swiftly, and create a gain. </p>
<p>Second, the only distinction in between your logo and that of another organization is in the characters of your corporation&#8217;s name. But even here, there is a problem. When an expert developer creates a logo for your business, the fonts are seldom applied without modifications</p>
<p>Instead, the designer applies kerning (at a minimum) to space the character types. He or she may furthermore implement one or more subtle effects (e.g. beveling, warping, etc.). A premade logo design rarely includes any of these things. The fonts are employed &#8220;directly from the box.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result is that your design will appear similar to many others. The stock icons and letters, utilized in thousands of additional trademarks, may not have the spark that a unique design and style offers.</p>
<p>Are You Sure Your Logo Design Template Isn&#8217;t Already Owned By Someone Else?</p>
<p>One of the unsightly trends in the template industry is that many of the templates have been stolen from other businesses. In a few cases, these organizations are the design companies that created the original logo for a client. Following its completion, they placed the model on their website as an illustration of their work. In other instances, these businesses are those for which the logos were developed.</p>
<p>This is essential simply because trademarks created utilizing pilfered templates may be subject to a lawful ownership challenge. They may fall under copyright and trademark law. Imagine applying a templated logo design on your pamphlets, <a href="http://www.stickergiant.com/bumper-sticker_bumper-stickers_pg1" target="_blank">bumper stickers</a>, mailers, letterhead, signs, and website only to have your ownership of it regarded lawfully unacceptable</p>
<p>Not only would your investment be wasted, but you would be pressured to begin again with a fresh style and design.</p>
<p>Steer clear of these troubles upfront. Make investments in a professionally designed logo design that effectively communicates your brand. While a $10 premade logo design might seem like a low cost &#8220;solution,&#8221; it might end up costing your company much more over the long haul.</p>

				<p>Graphic illustrators near the end of the 19th century were concerned with shape, design and pattern. This major shift in approach to graphic design can be traced back to one artist, who died at the young age of 26. Throughout the 20th century, artists have attempted to copy his personal interpretation of art nouveau style which he developed during his short life. Visit <a href="http://www.logodesignaustralia.org">logo designer australia</a> to learn more about design. </p>
<p>Oscar Wilde advocated and patronized an assortment of artistic movements, methods and styles. He deeply regarded the practice of art as an end unto itself. He felt that assessing art by ethical or standards was a misguided notion. He quickly became a polemical and substantial literary presence and remained so during his brief life. Wilde was drawn to Beardsley&#8217;s style, which was much like his own writing style; rich, erotic and fanciful. Using a combination of pattern, distortion, sweeping linear shapes, and a dark eroticism, this illustrator created images for his story. </p>
<p>The artwork he did is marked by stark juxtapositions between light and dark. The delicate patterns created on a white background are strongly contrasted with the large borders and other areas of darkness. His page is typically asymmetrical; movements are developed with big, not broken sinuous curves. His characters in the illustrations remain simple outlines, and yet the items that they contain, such as their clothing or hair, are usually complicated. This interactions between complicated details and simple, clean lines create much of the strength in his art. </p>
<p>A number of late 19th century design professionals were inspired by items imported from Japan and also by a rejuvenated fondness for early Renaissance and medieval artwork. The young designer&#8217;s work was copied far and wide in Europe and over the pond in the United States, thus giving him great fame from his illustrations, which appeared in many popular publications. Many of his pieces have been reproduced as prints and posters to be hung on the wall. Visit <a href="http://www.graphicdesignindia.co.in">graphic designer india</a> to learn more about design. </p>
<p>By the end of the 1800s, commercial ad imagery and poster art began to divide into separate forms of art. As opposed to the typically black and white books of the period, posters were frequently produced in color. The best known poster designer typically highlighted a single, large, vividly hued, striking subject. Informative text regarding the item or event in question were as short as they could be. He worked with powerful colors and simple shapes that were flat so that he would seize the viewers&#8217; attentions. The lines produced by this artist were usually somewhat halting and broken, not unlike those of an impressionist&#8217;s work. That&#8217;s the reason his work is still considered as the forerunner of the classic art nouveau designer poster. </p>
<p>Later illustrators employed bolder, smoother lines, creating a style that evolved into what is now known as the Art Nouveau Poster Style. His work is marked by youthful, willowy girls wearing loose fitting clothes and with long flowing hair that floats out into fantastic forms. A single full-length female image was another famous art nouveau poster; these works were created with narrow strips. Ornate, complex arrangements feature a range of influences, such as origami, Hebrew characters, Arab and Moorish embellishments, Byzantine mosaic work, Japanese wood cut examples and Celtic themes. </p>
<p>Books and reprints are available today for many of the turn-of-the-century artists. If you want the originals, there are dealers whose specialty is 19th and early 20th century pieces. These can generally be found by attending larger antique shows. These original pieces, in good condition, have been known to sell for thousands of dollars. </p>

				<p>Locating an experienced, talented developer to create a specialized logo for your organization is difficult. Ideally, you want to locate someone who uses a thorough design process. That person should be willing to research your sector, and design and prototype concepts that convey the right message</p>
<p>He or she should furthermore acquire an enthusiastic awareness in how you are planning to utilize your logo. You may need it sent in various file formats to make it simpler to incorporate into Flash animations, print pamphlets, <a href="http://www.stickergiant.com/bumper-sticker_bumper-stickers_pg1" target="_blank">bumper stickers</a>, or large-scale media (e.g. billboards). </p>
<p>This type of developer almost never, if ever, emerges from a crowdsourcing venture. Nevertheless, many companies continue to depend on this type of set up for their logos. The discussion that comes after may explain the concept of crowdsourcing, and provide a few of the hurdles you&#8217;ll deal with throughout the process. This is not meant to dissuade you from taking this path. Instead, our goal is to prepare you for the pitfalls that have ensnared others.</p>
<p>Logo Design Crowdsourcing Defined</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is a method for putting your project in front of a large team of contractors, and welcoming each to generate a share. In the framework of logo design, it generally takes the form of a competition. Developers send their trademarks, and you choose from amongst them, and pay off the victor.</p>
<p>On the surface, this looks like an attractive agreement for the firm. It is not uncommon to attract a bunch of designs for the price you might otherwise pay out to have a solitary expert company logo developed. There are, nevertheless, a couple of potential obstacles.</p>
<p>Setting Up A Sensible Cost To Bring In Volume</p>
<p>Establishing a price for your design contest can present a double-edged sword. A reduced selling price will help preserve your spending budget, but the excellence of the competition&#8217;s end result may be sketchy. Moreover, a reduced selling price may limit the number of designers who take part; on the other hand, establishing a high price may increase the excellence of the presented trademarks, but does not always guarantee you will receive a design and style you can use</p>
<p>Bear in mind most crowdsourcing sites require you to select a winner and award settlement. Therefore, your money could be squandered.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning how expert developers view these kinds of projects. Most logos are sent in secretly under a non-disclosure agreement, and thus can&#8217;t be employed in the designer&#8217;s portfolio; so they are likely to steer clear of these competitions unless of course the price offered is adequately substantial.</p>
<p>Copyright And Trademark Infringements</p>
<p>Here, we come to one of the most common difficulties of crowdsourcing your company logo design. A great deal of the work sent in by contest entrants infringes on existing copyrights or trademarks (or the two). Occasionally, only small portions of a design are &#8220;copied.&#8221; Other occasions, key portions are lifted</p>
<p>While this can happen with a professional developer, it occurs much more regularly throughout competitions. There are two main causes.</p>
<p>First, the website hosting the project generally lacks the manpower to police each and every logo design sent in to every contest. Copyright and trademark infringements slip through the cracks. Second, as pointed out, a lot of of the work is sent in privately. This indicates there are less eyes evaluating the work. In the unlikely occasion a developer is found &#8220;lifting&#8221; from other designs, he or she is rarely banned from going into additional contests.</p>
<p>In a worst case scenario, you might unwittingly select the lifted logo design, and use it on your brochures, website, and additional marketing collateral. The issue is, doing so puts you in a susceptible position should the copyright or trademark owner seek compensation.</p>
<p>Should You Crowdsource Your Logo Design?</p>
<p>Lots of professional designers claim that crowdsourcing will not generate a workable company logo; they argue the quality of the submitted works may be so poor that these kinds of contests are a waste of time, energy, and money. In truth, there&#8217;s a chance you will attract a skilled logo developer who follows a strict design process. The possibility of locating such a developer, however, is small</p>
<p>For most companies that want to avoid the prospective headaches of crowdsourcing, hiring a specialist upfront is a better answer.</p>

				<p>If you plan to limit usage of your business logo to your site or online marketing promotions, RGB (red, green, blue) color mode is sufficient; if, on the other hand, you plan to get your logo design published on business cards, pamphlets, and stationary, RGB is wrong. In the printing world, it&#8217;s a nonstarter.</p>
<p>Your printer may make use of one of two techniques when making your logo design: spot color or four color method. There are good and bad points linked with both approaches. This article is going to focus chiefly on spot color. We&#8217;ll describe the concept behind it, and describe some of its advantages and disadvantages. We&#8217;ll also make a few suggestions for making certain your logo design satisfies your expectations.</p>
<p>A Quick Definition Of Spot Color</p>
<p>Spot color printing uses inks which have been combined to make a particular tone. Mixtures are dependent on one of several color printing devices. The most common is the Pantone Matching System (PMS), but there are others, such as ANPA and TOYO. The Pantone version comprises a palette of more than 1,000 inks, and every color is provided a PMS number in order to identify it.</p>
<p>To clarify the spot color concept, it&#8217;s helpful to contrast it with four color system; this latter version is structured on the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) process. These four colors are displayed by individual inks. The inks are placed one at a time, layer upon layer, to reproduce every tone within your logo design. </p>
<p>There are circumstances for which four color system is proper, and even superior. That said, spot color - and specifically, the PMS system - is regarded as common in the company logo sector.</p>
<p>Advantages Of Using Spot Color In Your Logo</p>
<p>One of the rewards to utilizing spot color is that it is much more precise than four color process. The ink color scheme will even more accurately depict the individual tones in your company logo. The one limitation in this area involves treatment of coated (or, glossy) stock</p>
<p>On uncoated stock, such as letterhead stationary and envelopes, tones may be created exactly as revealed in the file sent by your developer. On glossy stock, a number of colors wander; this is hardly ever a significant issue, but still well worth bringing up. </p>
<p>One more benefit is that spot color is significantly less costly than four color process. The cause is because the mixed inks demand fewer moves beneath the plates. With the latter strategy, the colors are applied one by one, which indicates the paper or stock has to undergo a larger number of prints.</p>
<p>Possible Drawbacks To Spot Color</p>
<p>Using spot color does introduce a number of possible downsides. First, there might be motives to change your logo to four color approach for usage in certain media, for instance catalogs. Virtually all tones can be converted effortlessly from one system to the other. There are a few colors, on the other hand, that are tough to match perfectly. Thankfully, the distinctions are all but unattainable for many people to identify.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that a spot color logo design could only be printed utilizing a vector-based graphic. Raster images (i.e. those structured on pixels) cannot be reproduced precisely with spot color; they require a CMYK approach. It is worth mentioning your logo design should be designed and sent in vector data format, anyway.</p>
<p>Making Certain Custom Logo Designs Look Right</p>
<p>Ask your printer to supply a proof of the output prior to beginning the print job. The proof might not show the specific shades, but they will be near enough to figure out how they will look on the last product.</p>
<p>Also, realize that spot color on glossy and matte surfaces might create slightly different outcomes; this implies your company logo may show up differently on your <a href="http://www.stickergiant.com/bumper-sticker_bumper-stickers_pg1" target="_blank">bumper stickers</a> (with a glossy finish) and your letterhead (without the gloss). Occasionally, the only way to eliminate this problem is to change your spot color company logo to a CMYK job. Given that the variance in tone is typically minor, the expense of conversion may over-shadow the advantage.</p>
<p>Providing you convey your business needs to your logo developer and printer, they should be able to choose the correct approach. In many cases, a vector-based image printed using a spot color system is the finest option.</p>

				<p>Developing a business logo appears easy to those who&#8217;ve never done so. The largest, most widely used brands in the world utilize logos that lack sophistication</p>
<p>Walmart, Ford Motor Company, Apple, FedEx, and others have developed their brands with deceptively straightforward graphics. The problem is, this could lure inexperienced designers into a phony sense of comfort that developing a professional corporate logo is simple. In truth, it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to set up a number of guidelines that may help you develop a logo design that effectively conveys your corporation&#8217;s brand. While the following six tips won&#8217;t ensure a faultless style and design, they&#8217;ll help ensure your artwork is usable.</p>
<p>#1 - Streamline</p>
<p>Many business managers often overvalue sophistication in custom logo designs. There&#8217;s a widespread belief that sophisticated artwork is more difficult to create, and therefore well worth more. In truth, easy variations are often much more effective; they&#8217;re easier to identify, can be reproduced with better lucidity throughout various media (like business cards, television or <a href="http://www.stickergiant.com/custom_stickers/pages/custom-bumper-stickers.php" target="_blank">custom bumper stickers</a>), and have a greater impact on the audience. When possible, simplify your logo. Strip away unnecessary details that add very little to its primary idea.</p>
<p>#2 - Don&#8217;t Rely On Color</p>
<p>While your design may ultimately be displayed in color, it should be able to stand on its own without it. Color enhances the artwork, and helps support brand consistency; but it should be considered a lesser concern than the art itself. Start with black and white. Add color once the logo has been finished.</p>
<p>#3 - Omit Your Product Or Service</p>
<p>A lot of business proprietors develop their artwork in a fashion that bluntly expresses the goods or services they provide; for example, a veterinarian could possibly incorporate a pet dog; a jet ski company could integrate a jet ski; and a footwear business might include a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>With business logos, doing so is unnecessary. There are much better ways to instill trust in your audience. Consider that most of the planet&#8217;s very best brands don&#8217;t incorporate their product or service in their artwork.</p>
<p>#4 - Steer Clear Of Trendy</p>
<p>Nike&#8217;s famous swoosh has been integrated into countless company trademarks through the years. Although it occurs less often these days, a lot of companies continue to market their brands with artwork based on swooshes. In the beginning, this appears to be an easy method for creating a stylish design. After all, if the swoosh continues to be successful for Nike, why should other business owners anticipate any less?</p>
<p>Here, the issue is that the artwork is based on a pattern. The more companies that follow the trend, the bigger a clich? A particular design element - in this instance, a swoosh - will become. Avoid trends. They&#8217;re the antithesis of timelessness, which is a central goal of the custom logo procedure.</p>
<p>#5 - Develop For Adaptability And Versatility</p>
<p>You will likely be employing your company logo across online and offline media; for example, along with placing it on your site, you might utilize the artwork on billboards, decals, magazines, and even door hangers. Make sure your artwork is versatile across all types of media; develop it as a vector-based file</p>
<p>Not only can color reproduction become more accurate, but vector files are scalable without enduring a loss of lucidity. By contrast, bitmap - or raster - files become pixelated when enlarged.</p>
<p>#6 - Follow A Logo Design Process</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re simply exposed to the outcome of a professional logo designer&#8217;s creative procedure, you may think taking a haphazard approach is fine. However, the outcome is misleading. Professional designers follow a company logo process that requires industry research, conceptualizing, and revisions. In this process, a lot of designs are prototyped before the final result finally comes out. </p>
<p>This is the only reliable way for generating artwork that successfully conveys your company&#8217;s brand. It is the reason some of the earth&#8217;s largest companies have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars throughout the custom logo creation process.</p>
<p>There is, of course, much more that goes into designing a professional custom logo. However, the six suggestions above present a good foundation from which to build.</p>
