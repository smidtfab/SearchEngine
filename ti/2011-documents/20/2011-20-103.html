<p>

</p>

<p>Faster, cheaper, smarter, and more efficient. These words
might bring to mind the latest Intel ad, Moore's law, or hopes
for cell phone processors&#151;silicon, copper, and computation.
These circuits, however, are not only embodied in semiconductors.
Increasingly, masses of people sit at their keyboards computing
the answers to questions artificial intelligence cannot.
Programmers access these computing crowds through APIs or a GUI
on a service such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Working for a
couple of dollars an hour, these anonymous computing workers may
never meet the programmers who use them as part of their research
and engineering efforts. Who are these mysterious workers? What
kind of relationship do they have with the engineers who use them
as human computation? How should we, as computing researchers,
conceptualize the role of these people who we ask to power our
computing?</p>

<p>In this article we discuss findings which suggest that these
questions are increasingly important for those of us building the
collection of technologies, practices, and concepts called human
computation. We hope however that it will be understood as not
only about human computation. Rather we hope to link the thus-far
mainly technical conversations in human computation to
discussions of engineering ethics that have gone on for at least
forty years (see, e.g., Florman's Existential Pleasures of
Engineering and Papanek's Design for the Real World). Here we
offer insight into the practical problems crowdworkers face to
ground these discussions in the current conditions of human
computation.</p>

<p>Our research has focused on Mechanical Turk, a web platform
that allows people ("requesters") to post information tasks
called Human Intelligence Tasks ("HITs") for completion by other
people ("workers" or "Turkers"), usually for a fee between one
cent and a few dollars. Many businesses with large amounts of
data use Mechanical Turk to create metadata and remove duplicate
entries from their databases. Audio transcription and moderation
of user-generated content on "Web 2.0" sites are other popular
applications (see <b><a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#F1">Figures 1</a> and
<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#F2">2</a>)</b>.</p>

<p>After a worker submits a HIT, the requester can decide to
"accept" the work and pay the worker, or "reject" it and keep the
work for free. The site keeps track of how often workers'
submissions are accepted and rejected, and requesters use these
rates to screen workers. When requesters reject work, they hurt
workers' ability to get more work (especially more highly paid
work) in the future. The frequencies with which requesters accept
and reject work, however, are not made available to workers. This
information asymmetry underlies many of the difficulties we
discuss in this article.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, human computation research has focused on
problems facing the requesters of human computation, and most
investigations of workers have aimed to motivate better, cheaper,
and faster worker performance. This makes sense sociologically:
most researchers are requesters. Put simply, the requester's
problem is to get good data from workers, quickly and without
paying much. Workers, however, also have interesting and
difficult practical problems.</p>

<p>Our last year studying Mechanical Turk from a worker point of
view [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R1">1</a>, <a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R2">2</a>] offers insights into
opportunities for human computation researchers to think more
broadly about the people who are crucial to the systems they
build. We summarize the results of demographic studies of workers
in Mechanical Turk and describe some of the problems faced by
Turkers, as some workers call themselves. We present several
projects, including one we built, that approach some of these
problems. Finally, we explore open questions of interest to
workers, requesters, and researchers.</p>

<b>The Crowd and Its Problems</b>
</p>

<p>"I don't care about the penny I didn't earn for knowing the
difference between an apple and a giraffe. I'm angry that AMT
will take requesters' money but not manage, oversee, or mediate
the problems and injustices on their site."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151;<i>An
anonymous worker</i></p>

<p>Abstraction hides detail. The very abstraction that lets human
computation researchers access thousands of workers in a click
also renders invisible the practical problems faced by people in
the crowdworking workforce. A number of surveys and active web
forums offer glimpses behind the curtain where "artificial
artificial intelligence" is made.</p>

<p>

<b>Working Hard for the Money</b>
</p>

<p>The Mechanical Turk labor pool hosts a growing international
population earning less than $10,000 per year, some of whom rely
on Turking income to make basic ends meet. Ross et al.
[<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R2">2</a>], extending work by Ipeirotis
[<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R3">3</a>], present longitudinal demographic data on
Mechanical Turk workers.</p>

<p>While Indian residents made up only 5 percent of respondents
to a November 2008 survey, they comprised 36 percent of
respondents to a November 2009 survey and 46 percent in February
2010, at which point American Turkers, formerly the majority,
comprised only 39 percent of survey respondents. Many of these
new Indian Turkers are young men earning less than $10,000 a
year. Almost a third of Indian Turkers surveyed reported that
they always or sometimes relied on their Turking income to "make
basic ends meet." Between May 2009 and February 2010, the
fraction of U.S. Turkers surveyed reporting reliance held steady
at 13&plusmn;1 percent.</p>

<p>Many Turkers see themselves as laborers doing work to earn
money. In survey data collected in February 2009 (<i>n</i>=878),
the most commonly reported motivation for doing HITs was payment:
91 percent of respondents mentioned a desire to make money.
Turking to pass the time, in contrast, was mentioned by only 42
percent of respondents. February 2010 data (<i>n</i>=1,000) from
Ipeirotis confirms the importance of money compared to other
motivations, with most respondents reporting they do not do HITs
for fun or to kill time. 25 percent of Indian respondents and 13
percent of U.S. respondents reported that Mechanical Turk is
their primary source of income.</p>

<p>

<b>Occupational Hazards</b>
</p>

<p>What challenges face these professional crowdworkers? Several
researchers have engaged workers by posting open-ended questions
to Mechanical Turk&#151;a sort of online interview to access a
generally invisible population and see the world from their
perspective. We have also conducted interviews of workers through
Skype and participated in the forums where they share tips, talk
about work, and virtually meet their coworkers. Turkers often
advise one another on the occupational hazards of human
computing:</p>

<p><b>Employers who don't pay:</b> When workers submit work to
employers through Mechanical Turk, they have no guarantee of
receiving payment for their work. The site terms state that
employers "pay only when [they're] satisfied with the
results."</p>

<p>While this makes Mechanical Turk highly attractive to
employers it leaves workers vulnerable to the whims of
employers&#151;or, just as likely, employers' evaluation
software&#151;judging the merit of their work. The amount of
work often makes it impractical for employers to evaluate
manually. Because employers hire hundreds or more workers at a
time, they puzzle rejected workers with generic messages giving
reasons for rejection, if they explain their decision at all. At
worst, ill-intentioned employers post large batches of tasks with
high pay, receive the work, and reject it as a way of obtaining
free work. Such rejected work leaves workers feeling vulnerable,
reduces their effective wage, and lowers their work acceptance
rate.</p>

<p><b>Staying safe online:</b> Mechanical Turk workers have to
learn to identify illegitimate tasks to stay safe online.
Administrator spamgirl on Turker Nation, a forum for workers,
outlines tasks to avoid:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Do not do any HITs that involve: filling in CAPTCHAs;
secret shopping; test our web page; test zip code; free trial;
click my link; surveys or quizzes (unless the requester is listed
with a smiley in the Hall of Fame/Shame); anything that involves
sending a text message; or basically anything that asks for any
personal information at all&#151;even your zip code. If you feel
in your gut it's not on the level, IT'S NOT. Why? Because they
are scams</i>...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The discussion that ensued identified malware, sale of
personal information and wage theft as risks workers face
choosing among jobs.</p>

<p><b>"Why is there no control?"</b> Hit by several of the
problems described above, a4x401 offered a newcomer's frustrated
perspective with the worker side of human computation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Being a newbie and having relatively decent PC skills, I
have been checking all this stuff out and am somewhat upset
[about] the things that I have discovered! It's no wonder that
people don't trust the requesters, yes I did some of those HITs
that one should not do and found myself having to repair my PC
and remove some pop-ups. After having done that I really got into
checking out the program and realized that it's too easy to
manipulate it due the fact that work can be rejected after it's
finished but the work is still done. All [a requester] has to say
is "not to our satisfaction"!!!!! The other way is to just leave
the HITs open; you still collect your work but don't have to pay!
My favorite part is HITs that are way too complicated to complete
in the time frame allowed! Why is there no control on any of this
stuff?</i> [Edited for punctuation and spelling.]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He echoes experiences many report on worker forums and in
research surveys. Workers report trying to contact Amazon staff
but receiving little response.</p>

<p><b>Costs of requester and administrator errors are often borne
by workers:</b> When a requester posts a buggy task or a task
with inadequate instructions, they often don't get the responses
they want from workers and reject the work. One worker wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>I would like to see the ability to return a HIT as
defective so it dings the requester's reputation and not mine.
Let's face it, if I'm supposed to find an item for sale on Amazon
but they show me a child's crayon drawing...there really
needs to be a way to handle that without it altering my
numbers</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, occasionally requesters will post a task with a
prohibitively short time limit, and the task expires before
workers can complete it. This lowers workers' effective wage and
affects the worker's reputation statistics rather than the
requester's.</p>

<p>At present, largely owing to requester and administrator
unresponsiveness, workers can do little to improve the conditions
of their tasks. Unsurprisingly, some have expressed interest in a
more relationship-oriented approach to distributing work. One
Turker wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>We the Turks, in a world that requires productivity in
working together, will work honestly and diligently to perform
the best work we can. The Requestors, in turn, will provide
useful work and will pay us fairly and quickly, providing bonuses
for especially good work. The goal is to create a working
environment that benefits us all and will allow us the dignity
and motivation to continue working together</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These are some of the more prevalent phenomena we've
encountered. For more, see <a
href="http://turkernation.com">turkernation.com</a> and <a
href="http://mturkforum.com">mturkforum.com</a>, especially their
"Suggestions" boards.</p>

<p>

<b>Approaches to Worker Problems</b>
</p>

<p>Software tools exist, some built by Turkers, that attempt to
help Turkers manage these problems. Many are client-side scripts
that add functionality to the Mechanical Turk interface. At least
one platform aims to compete with Mechanical Turk.</p>

<p><b>Augmenting Mechanical turk from the outside:</b> Workers
and requesters have made a number of Turking tools, including a
list of all requesters, a script for recording your own worker
history (not preserved by Mechanical Turk, but useful for tax
purposes), and a clientside script to hide HITs posted by
particular requesters.</p>

<p>Motivated by the problems above, we built Turkopticon
(turkopticon.differenceengines.com) in 2008, a database-backed
Firefox add-on that augments Mechanical Turk's HIT listing. The
extension adds worker-written reviews of requesters to the
interface (see <b><a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#F3">Figures 3</a>, <a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#F4">4</a>,
and <a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#F5">5</a>);</b> the next version will compute
effective wage data for HITs and requesters. Some Turkers have
been enthusiastic about Turkopticon. One early adopter posted to
Turker Nation, "if you do not have this, please get it!!!! it
does work and is worth it !!"</p>

<p>This was a proud moment for us, and we have attempted to
respond to feature requests and provide support for new users.
Turkopticon users have contributed over 7000 reviews of over 3000
requesters, but the user base has remained very small, especially
compared to the total number of Turkers. Relatedly, some Turkers
have pointed out that a third-party review database is no
subsitute for a robust, built-in requester reputation system.</p>

<p><b>Building alternative human computation platforms:</b>
CloudCrowd, launched in September 2009, aims to provide a
"worker-friendly" alternative to Mechanical Turk. In a post to
mTurk Forum, CEO Alex Edelstein writes that CloudCrowd will offer
"a more efficient [worker] interface," payment through PayPal
(allowing workers to collect currencies other than USD and INR,
the only choices for Turkers), and "credibility" ratings (in
place of acceptance rates as in Mechanical Turk) as the measure
of worker quality.</p>

<p>Kochhar et al., in a paper at HCOMP 2010 [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R4">4</a>],
documented the success of a relationship-oriented approach to
distributing work in the design of a "closed" large-scale human
computation platform.</p>

<p><b>Offering workers legal protections:</b> Alek Felstiner has
raised the question of legal protections for crowdworkers,
asking, "what [legal] responsibilities, if any, attach to the
companies that develop, market, and run online crowd-sourcing
venues?" In his working paper [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R5">5</a>] he explores the
difficulties that arise in the application of traditional
employment and labor law to human computation markets.</p>

<p>

<b>Open Questions</b>
</p>

<p>The projects listed above are tentative steps toward
addressing the problems facing Turkers and developing a richer
understanding of the structure and dynamics of human computation
markets. Many questions remain, including: How does database,
interface, and interaction design influence individual outcomes
and market equilibria?</p>

<p>For example, how would the worker experience on Mechanical
Turk be different if workers knew requesters' rejection rates, or
the effective wages of HITs? This has been explored in online
auctions, especially eBay, but only tentatively in human
computation (e.g., [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R6">6</a>], which examines task
search).</p>

<p>Another question is: What are the economics of fraudulent
tasks (scamming and spamming)?</p>

<p>That is, how do scammers and spammers make money on Mechanical
Turk, and how much money do they make? Work in this thread might
draw on existing research on the economics of internet fraud
(e.g., [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R7">7</a>]) and could yield insights to help make
human computation markets less hospitable to fraudsters.</p>

<p>A third question is: What decision logics are used by buyers
and sellers in human computation markets?</p>

<p>We might expect workers to minimize time spent securing
payment on each task, even if this means providing work they know
is of low quality. Some workers do behave this way. We have
found, however, that workers seem more concerned with what is
"fair" and "reasonable" than with maximizing personal earnings at
requester expense. The selfish optimizers that populate the
models of economic decision-making may not well describe these
"honest" workers, although as noted in [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R8">8</a>] they
can perhaps be extended to do so. So how do differently motivated
actors in human computation markets shape market outcomes, and
how can this knowledge shape design?</p>

<p>Finally, we can ask: What's fair in paid crowdsourcing?</p>

<p>Economists Akerlof and Shiller, in their 2009 book <i>Animal
Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It
Matters for Global Capitalism</i>, argue that "considerations of
fairness are a major motivator in many economic decisions" that
has been overlooked in neoclassical explanations that assume
people act rationally: "while...there is a considerable
literature on what is fair or unfair, there is also a tradition
that such considerations should take second place in the
explanation of economic events" (pp. 20, 25).</p>

<p>At public events we have heard Mechanical Turk requesters and
administrators say tasks should be priced "fairly," but fairness
is difficult to define and thus to operationalize. The concept of
a reservation wage&#151;the lowest wage a worker will take for a
given task&#151;as discussed in [<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869100/#R9">9</a>] is useful
but not definitive: the global reach of human computation
platforms complicates the social and cultural interpretation of
the reservation wage.</p>

<p>The question of fairness links interface design to market
outcomes. If considerations of fairness are key to explaining
economic decision making, but fairness is constructed and
interpreted through social interaction, then to understand
economic outcomes in human computation systems we need an
understanding of these systems as social environments. Can
systems with sparse social cues motivate fair interactions? Human
computation and Computer Supported Cooperative Work may have much
to learn from one another on these topics.</p>

<b>Looking Forward</b>
</p>

<p>This review of workers' problems should not be mistaken as an
argument that workers would be better off without Mechanical
Turk. An exchange in late 2009 on the Turker Nation forum makes
the point concisely:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>xeroblade:</b> <i>I am worried that Amazon might just shut
the service down because it's becoming full of spammers</i>.</p>

<p><b>jml:</b> <i>Please don't say that :(</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>With Mechanical Turk, Amazon has created work in a time of
economic uncertainty for many. Our aim here is not to criticize
the endeavor as a whole but to foreground complexities and
articulate desiderata that have thus far been overlooked. Basic
economic analysis tells us that if two parties transact they do
so because it makes them both better off. But it tells us nothing
about the conditions of the transaction. How did the parties come
to a situation in which such a transaction was an improvement?
When transactions are conditioned by the intentional design of
systems, we have the opportunity to examine those conditions.</p>

<p>Human computation has brought Taylorism&#151;the "scientific
management" of labor&#151;to information work. If it continues
to develop and grow, many of us "information workers" may become
human computation workers. This is a selfish reason to examine
design practices and workers' experiences in these systems. But
the underlying question is simple: are we, as designers and
administrators, creating contexts in which people will treat each
other as human beings in a social relation? Or are we creating
contexts in which they will be seduced by the economically
convenient fiction alluded to by Mechanical Turk's tagline,
"artificial artificial intelligence"&#151;that is, that these
people are machines and should be treated as such?</p>
