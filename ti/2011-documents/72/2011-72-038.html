<div class="KonaBody"><div class="article_bod" style="margin-top: 45px;"><div class="article_bod" style="overflow:auto; padding-left: 25px;"><P>  The relationship between sources of motivation and influence
tactics and the moderating effect of the Machiavellian disposition are
explored in this review of the literature in the areas of influence
tactics, Machiavellian personality, and human motivation to develop the
proposed framework(s). Propositions are developed linking motivation
sources, influence tactics, and Machiavellian personality. Implications
for research and practice also are discussed.
</P><P>  **********
</P><P>  "Be it known, then, that there are two ways of contending, one
in accordance with the laws, the other by force, the first of which is
proper to men, the second to beasts. But since the first method is often
ineffectual, it becomes necessary to resort to the second. A prince
should, therefore, understand how to use well both man and beast"
(Machiavelli, 1513/1902, p. 79).
</P><P>  At the heart of Machiavelli's pronouncement are the notions of
power and influence. Recent research efforts have sought to examine the
specific influencing strategies used by leaders (agents) to effect
changes in the decisions and actions of their followers (targets). These
proactive actions have been termed influence tactics (Kipnis, Schmidt,
&amp; Wilkinson, 1980; Mowday, 1978). Influence tactics have been
examined extensively and from multiple perspectives over the past twenty
years (Ferris et al., 1997; Kipnis et al., 1980; Yukl, 1998). Despite
the attention, there remains limited understanding of the antecedents of
these tactics.
</P><P>  Several studies have examined the antecedents of influence tactics,
using such variables as gender (Strutton, Pelton &amp; Lumpkin, 1995;
Tepper, Brown &amp; Hunt, 1993; Thacker, 1995), objectives of influence
(Yukl &amp; Falbe, 1990), power (Hinkin &amp; Schriescheim, 1990; Judge
&amp; Bretz, 1994; Lamude, 1994), motivation (Aguinis, Nesler, Hosoda,
&amp; Tedeschi, 1993; Barbuto, Fritz, Maxx, 2002; Barbuto &amp; Scholl,
1999; Yukl &amp; Falbe, 1990), direction of influence (Falbe &amp; Yukl,
1992), and personality (Blickle, 2000; Harrell-Cook, Ferris, &amp;
Dulebohn, 1999; Kipnis et al., 1980).
</P><P>  This paper explores the relationship between motivation and
influence tactics, and the role personality plays in this relationship.
The personality variable examined in this framework is the need to
develop and defend power and success, as defined by Niccolo Machiavelli
(1513/1902). The perspective of organizational dynamics articulated by
Machiavelli has been criticized because of its honest acceptance of
aggressive--and perhaps unethical--behaviors to achieve a goal. The
impact of Machiavellianism on the influence process has been examined
minimally (Christie &amp; Geis, 1979; Grams &amp; Rogers, 1989; Kets de
Vries &amp; Miller, 1985); however, in this framework, Machiavellianism
is considered for its moderating value in the relationship between
motivation and influence tactics.
</P><P>  Three models are developed to explain the expected relationships
among motivation, Machiavellianism, and influence. The first model
(Figure 7) depicts situational and dispositional models and the impact
of high versus low Machiavellian personalities. The second model (Figure
8) explores the direct relationship between Machiavellianism and
influence tactics in initial and repeated influence attempts. The third
model (Figure 9) explains the moderating effect of the Machiavellian
personality on the relationship between motivation sources and influence
tactic use.
</P><P>  [FIGURES 7-9 OMITTED]
</P><P>  For almost 500 years, since the time of Niccolo Machiavelli,
leadership behaviors have been widely discussed. The perspectives of
Machiavelli (1513/1902) have been adopted by scholars to examine and
understand political dynamics in organizations. Machiavelli is well
known for such generalizations as "the ends justify the means"
and the contention that unethical behavior is acceptable, even
necessary, if it helps attain goals or protect political position. Yet
these perspectives capture only a faint image of what Machiavelli
intended in his writings. For example, Martinez (1987) found that while
high Machiavellians may endorse deceit and opportunism, they
nevertheless might be as moral as low Machiavellians in other areas of
sociopolitical belief. A wider perspective of the Machiavellian
disposition will be discussed in this paper.
</P><P>  INFLUENCE TACTICS
</P><P>  While power is the ability to influence, influence can be defined
as the actual effect on an individual's behavior, beliefs, and
attitudes (Hinkin &amp; Schriesheim, 1990). Pfeffer (1981) defined
influence as the ability to exercise power in order to overcome
resistance in achieving a desired objective or result. Mintzberg (1973)
argued that to appreciate organizational behavior, we must understand
the influencers present within the organization, as well as the needs of
each influencer, and the extent to which each can exercise power to
satisfy those needs. Mintzberg (1983) described influencers as the
individuals who seek to control the organization's decisions and
actions. The ability to influence others is at the very heart of power,
politics and organizational life.
</P><P>  The work of Kipnis et al. (1980) first operationalized proactive
influence tactics by studying agents (those using influence tactics) and
the many strategies employees use to get their way with superiors.
Influence tactics, as articulated by Hughes, Ginnett, and Curphy (as
cited in Wren, 1995), refer to actual behaviors designed to change
another person's attitudes, beliefs, values, or behaviors. The
original taxonomy was derived from inductive research methods and
featured six influence tactics (assertiveness, rationality,
ingratiation, exchange, upward appeal, and coalition).
</P><P>  Schriesheim and Hinkin (1990) replicated the study by Kipnis et al.
(1980) and developed new items to measure the same subscales. Yukl and
colleagues (Yukl &amp; Falbe, 1990; Yukl &amp; Tracey, 1992) examined
influence tactics from the perspectives of both agent and target, and
also extended the work of Kipnis et al. by identifying the additional
tactics of inspirational appeal, legitimating, consultation, pressure,
and personal appeal.
</P><P>  Yukl and Falbe (1990) determined that consultation and rational
persuasion were the most frequently used influence tactics. This
conclusion coincides with the research results of Hinkin and Schriesheim
(1990), who found that rational persuasion has significant positive
relationships with the more positively viewed bases of power (expert and
referent).
</P><P>  Situational predictors of the influence tactics chosen by leaders
also have been examined (Barbuto, 2000; Bass, 1985; Katz &amp; Kahn,
1978), and it can be argued that leaders use more interpersonal or
inspirational influence strategies when encouraging colleagues to do
tasks that they highly resist. Barbuto's (2000) review of the
literature found that leaders use "soft" tactics when seeking
performance beyond expectations (Barbuto, Fritz, &amp; Marx, 2000; Barry
&amp; Shapiro, 1992; Bass, 1985; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Morrman, &amp;
Fetter, 1990).
</P><P>  Barbuto, Fritz, and Marx (2002) examined the relationship between
the degree to which a leader expects employee resistance to a task and
the influence tactics used to gain compliance from targets. Earlier,
Barbuto (2000) suggested that leaders/managers often misinterpret
employee resistance to requested tasks and mistakenly underestimate a
follower' s willingness to perform tasks. Barbuto et al. (2001)
found that leaders use soft tactics when anticipating higher resistance
from workers. They also found a correlation (r = .22) between
leaders' use of soft tactics and the lowest level of anticipated
resistance. Anticipated resistance was positively related to
leaders' use of ingratiating, consultative, and coalition influence
tactics (Barbuto, et al., 2001).
</P><P>  Barbuto and Scholl (1999) studied the relationships between
leaders' motivation sources, their perceptions of their
targets' motivation sources, and their choices of influence
tactics. Results indicated strong relationships between leaders'
perceptions of targets' sources of motivation and the use of
influence tactics. Leaders' own sources of motivation were strongly
correlated with their perceptions of their targets' motivation.
</P><P>  SOURCES OF MOTIVATION AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO INFLUENCE TACTICS
</P><P>  Leaders who understand their personal motivation sources, most
preferred influence tactic, and least preferred influence tactic are
more likely to practice more effective management. Effective management
practices foster creativity in individuals (Tierney, Farmer, &amp;
Graen, 1999) and increase employee motivation (Richer &amp; Vallerand,
1995) and self-determination (Deci, Connell, &amp; Ryan, 1989). In
addition, it has been proposed (Barbuto, 2000) that follower compliance
can affect influence triggers (the reactions of followers to a
leader's interventions).
</P><P>  Motivation has been researched from a variety of perspectives.
Maslow (1943) and Alderfer (1969) developed needs-based theories of
motivation; Adams (1963) examined equity theory as it relates to
motivation. Herzberg studied dissatisfiers (1968); McClelland (1966)
looked at motivation from the viewpoint of opportunity and challenge;
and Deci (1975, 1989) examined intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.
</P><P>  An integrative taxonomy, built on past research efforts, can
account for various motivations necessary to understand individual
behavior. Leonard, Beauvais, and Scholl (1999) developed an integrative
taxonomy for the five sources model, incorporating the perspectives of
several motivation theorists. The five sources of motivation they
identified include intrinsic process, instrumental, self-concept
external, self concept internal, and goal internalization.
</P><P>  Described briefly, intrinsic process motivation is motivation
derived from the work itself. Intrinsic process motivation is evident
when workers enjoy what they are doing. Instrumental motivation derives
from an individual's search for tangible outcomes such as pay,
promotions, or bonuses. Self-concept external motivation is derived from
identification with a group and the achievement of status and
recognition from that group. Self-concept internal motivation is derived
from internal standards of achievement that become the basis for the
ideal self. Goal internalization motivation is derived from an
individual's values and their congruence with organizational goals
(Leonard, et al, 1999).
</P><P>  Intrinsic Process Motivation and Influence Tactics
</P><P>  Barbuto and Scholl (1999) found that individuals' sources of
motivation are related to their choices of influence tactics; they
reported positive correlations between intrinsic process motivation and
legitimating, ingratiation, and personal appeals influence tactics.
However, Barbuto et al. (2002) reported positive correlations between
intrinsic process motivation and legitimating, rational persuasion,
personal appeals, pressure, exchange, ingratiating, and coalition
tactics.
</P><P>  Of the "hard" influence tactics, the legitimating tactic
focuses on the individual's situation or position. An intrinsically
motivated individual might use this tactic in order to proceed with the
work he or she finds enjoyable. Ingratiation involves getting others in
a good mood or causing them to think favorably of the requestor before
asking them to do something. Intrinsically motivated individuals might
find this kind of interaction fun and a means to get what they want. A
personal appeal involves the reliance on personal favors or
interpersonal relationships, and intrinsically motivated individuals
might find these relationships fun to maintain. The relationship between
intrinsic process motivation and influence tactics used is likely to be
small, given the contradictory and inconsistent findings of past
research.
</P><P>  Proposition 1: Individuals' intrinsic process motivation will
be positively related to their use of ingratiation, personal appeals,
consultative, and legitimating influence tactics. These relationships
are expected to be relatively weak.
</P><P>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
</P><P>  Instrumental Motivation and Influence Tactics
</P><P>  Individuals high in instrumental motivation are driven by the
exchange of tangible benefits for their efforts. They tend to weigh the
efforts of an act to the corresponding "payment" for that
effort. Barbuto and Scholl (1999) found that leaders high in
instrumental motivation used hard influence tactics such as pressure,
legitimation, coalitions, and exchanges.
</P><P>  Pressure involves demands, threats and intimidation. Instrumentally
motivated individuals would be comfortable using these methods to
achieve their tangible goals because they place such goals above
interpersonal relationships or emotional requests. Legitimating tactics
seek compliance based on position or situation. Instrumentally motivated
individuals are more inclined to use position and hierarchical
situations to achieve tangible benefits. Coalitions involve the support
of others to gain compliance--similar to creating peer pressure or
ganging up on another. Instrumentally motivated individuals seek
opportunities to make tangible gains with the support of others.
Exchange involves reciprocation, or trading, of tangible benefits. Those
motivated by tangible rewards, such as those high in instrumental
motivation, would be prone to use exchange tactics. Indeed, Barbuto et
al. (2002) found positive correlation between instrumental motivation
and exchange.
</P><P>  Proposition 2: Individuals' instrumental motivation will be
positively related to their use of hard tactics such as exchange,
pressure, coalitions, and legitimation.
</P><P>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
</P><P>  Self-Concept External Motivation and Influence Tactics
</P><P>  Individuals high in self-concept external motivation feel motivated
by gaining approval from and affiliation with others. They may avoid
alienation from the group and would want group members to think highly
by them. Barbuto and Scholl (1999) found a relationship between
leaders' self-concept external motivation and their use of
interpersonal influence tactics such as ingratiation, personal appeals,
and coalitions. Barbuto et al. (2002) found positive relationships
between self-concept external motivation and personal appeals and
exchange influence tactics. Across both studies, only the relationship
between self-concept external motivation and personal appeals tactics
was replicated. For this reason, this relationship is expected to be
strongest, Leaders high in self-concept external motivation may use
coalition influence tactics because they value group acceptance and
pursue status within the group, and would thus be more inclined to
pursue compliance from others based on social and peer group pressures.
</P><P>  Proposition 3: Individuals' self-concept external motivation
will be positively related to their use of soft and hard influence
tactics such as coalitions, personal appeals, and ingratiating tactics.
The strongest relationship is expected between self-concept external
motivation and personal appeals tactics.
</P><P>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
</P><P>  Self-Concept Internal Motivation and Influence Tactics
</P><P>  Individuals high in self-concept internal motivation are internally
motivated. They set personal standards for performance and self monitor
their progress, striving to reach optimal personal achievement. Barbuto
and Scholl (1999) found self-concept internal motivation to be related
to leaders' use of soft tactics (inspirational appeals and
consultative tactics). However, Barbuto et al. (2002) found significant
negative relationships between self-concept internal motivation and both
legitimating tactics and rational persuasion. Given the conflicting
results between the two studies, it is prudent to anticipate modest
relationships.
</P><P>  Inspirational appeals are characterized as those that tap into
values and emotions. Since self-concept internally motivated individuals
have a clear concept of their values, they are more likely to tap into
the values of others.
</P><P>  Consultative tactics are used by those who solicit participation
from others in decision-making--usually seeking from targets at early
stages of a project input about how to proceed with plans. Because
self-concept internally motivated individuals have high standards for
their own performance, they are likely to seek input from talented
individuals to best reach their personal achievement level.
</P><P>  Proposition 4: Individuals' self-concept internal motivation
will be positively related to their use of soft influence tactics such
as inspirational appeals and consultative tactics. Modest relationships
should be expected.
</P><P>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
</P><P>  Goal Internalization Motivation and Influence Tactics
</P><P>  Individuals high in goal internalization as a motivation source
will place high valence on the degree to which goals of the organization
are congruent with their own values and beliefs. Barbuto and Scholl
(1999) found a relationship between goal internalization motivation and
leaders' use of soft tactics, such as inspirational appeals and
consultation. However, Barbuto et al. (2002) did not find any
significant relationships between goal internalization and influence
tactics. Goal internalized individuals are more predisposed to focus on
the values of the organization when influencing others, and thus may
rely upon inspirational appeals that tap into the values and emotions of
targets to gain compliance. They also might seek participation in
decisions from those most capable of contributing in order to meet the
organizational goals.
</P><P>  Proposition 5: Individuals' goal internalization motivation
will relate to their use of inspirational appeals and consultative
tactics.
</P><P>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
</P><P>  MACHIAVELLIANISM AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO INFLUENCE TACTICS
</P><P>  "It is necessary, indeed, to put a good colour on this nature,
and to be skillful in simulating and dissembling. But men are so simple,
and governed so absolutely by their present needs, that he who wishes to
deceive will never fail in finding willing dupes ... A Prince should
therefore be careful that nothing ever escapes his lips which is not ...
the embodiment of mercy, good faith, integrity, humanity and religion
..." (Machiavelli, 1513/1902, p. 80)
</P><P>  Machiavelli's (1513/1902) work The Prince provided the basis
of the Machiavellian personality type coined by Christie and Geis
(1970). The traditional Machiavellian perspective advocates that the
leader's main goal is to be in power at all costs, whereby the end
justifies the means as long as power is retained.
</P><P>  The Machiavellian personality type has been researched extensively.
Initial research found individuals who were strong in the Machiavellian
disposition to be controlling, manipulative, and ruthless (Christie
&amp; Geis, 1970). However, recent research has shown that individuals
higher in the Machiavellian disposition are more flexible in their
choices of influence tactics than individuals lower in the Machiavellian
disposition (Grams &amp; Rogers, 1989), and are more likely to exhibit
self-monitoring behaviors (Snyder, 1974). The Machiavellian personality
has been positively correlated with certain types of planning for
communication in interpersonal situations, indicating that high
Machiavellians give thought to how to influence others (Allen, 1990).
</P><P>  Those who score high on a Machiavellian assessment instrument would
be more flexible in choosing influence tactics most likely to lead to
follower compliance (Carpenter, 1990). Those scoring low on a
Machiavellian assessment would be less likely to strategically alter
their behavior. Another factor contributing to the high
Machiavellian's flexibility of behavior might be the ability to use
self-monitoring to read and use environmental cues to determine
behavior. Research has shown a strong relationship between
Machiavellianism and self-monitoring (Leone, 1994; Snyder, 1974).
</P><P>  Under the situational model, a high Machiavellian disposition would
affect the relationship between an individual's motivation source
and influence tactic choice, because he or she would be able to alter
behavior according to the situation. By contrast, the dispositional
model indicates that the low Machiavellian is less likely to alter
behavior. Therefore, the situation does not become a factor in that
individual's influence behavior, demonstrating again that the
individual's motivation source has a direct relationship with his
or her influence tactic choice.
</P><P>  Machiavellianism in Initial and Repeated Influence Attempts
</P><P>  Machiavellians display superb negotiation skills, and their ability
to influence is impressive (Christie &amp; Geis, 1970). Kets de Vries
and Miller (1985) related narcissism to the Machiavellian personality
when they described the self-deceptive variety of narcissism.
Narcissistic individuals were said to display a lack of empathy and fear
of failure and were considered "ideal-hungry," preoccupied
with their own needs, and strongly desirous of being loved, as well as
having a transactional/instrumental orientation.
</P><P>  Grams and Rogers (1989) examined influence tactics and personality
characteristics and found that the choice of influence tactic differs
dramatically according to whether a person is high or low in the
Machiavellian disposition. Individuals with a high Machiavellian
disposition are more motivated to succeed, more assertive, and less
manipulative. Additionally, resistance from the target changes the
leader's influence strategy. Those high in the Machiavellian
disposition prefer to use indirect (emotion) and non-rational (reward)
persuasion techniques. High Machiavellians display positive emotional
techniques (flattery, friendliness) that aid in their influence
attempts. Individuals high in Machiavellianism want to succeed by using
the least obtrusive means possible but are willing to resort to stronger
or harder tactics if necessary.
</P><P>  Low Machiavellians, on the other hand, use logic and simple
statements of their requests and seem not to understand that others
might resist their logical approach. They demonstrate inflexibility in
behavior (Grams &amp; Rogers, 1989), and Fry (1985) found that low
Machiavellians are particularly vulnerable in face-to-face bargaining
situations. This suggests that individuals low in Machiavellianism are
more likely to allow their dispositions to determine their behavior,
whereas those leaders high in Machiavellianism are more likely to use
situational factors (such as organizational setting) to select their
behavior.
</P><P>  Because Machiavellian personalities are characterized by concern
with a personal agenda, maintaining position power, and influencing
others, they are extremely flexible in their influence tactic choices.
They will use whatever tactic they feel will help them maintain power
and pursue their personal (and organizational) goals. However, because
the Machiavellian wants to avoid being hated and develop a `popular
goodwill' among his or her followers: "Nevertheless a prince
ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he
avoids hatred" (Machiavelli, 1513/1902, p. 83).
</P><P>  If given the choice, the true Machiavellian leader would use soft
tactics first to influence others, then, once initial soft attempts have
failed, the Machiavellian leader would resort to hard influence tactics.
Although Machiavellian leaders are not afraid to utilize cruel measures
to attain their goals, they will do so only when softer approaches will
lead to greater harm. "Therefore, a prince, so long as he keeps his
subjects united and loyal, ought not mind the reproach of cruelty;
because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who,
through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow
murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people,
whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the
individual only" (Machiavelli, 1513/1902, p. 75).
</P><P>  Proposition 6: During initial influence attempts, Machiavellian
personality will be positively related to the use of soft influence
tactics.
</P><P>  Proposition 7: During repeated influence attempts, Machiavellian
personality will be positively related to the use of hard influence
tactics.
</P><P>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]
</P><P>  Role of the Machiavellian Disposition in the Relationship Between
Motivation and Influence
</P><P>  In addition to the direct relationship Between Machiavellianism and
influence tactics specified in the previous section, Machiavellianism is
expected to play a moderating role between motivation sources and
influence tactics because individuals high on the Machiavellian score
will be comfortable using various influence strategies and methods to
get what they want. An individual with a high Machiavellian score is
willing to step outside the bounds of formal authority. Low
Machiavellians, on the other hand, tend to be overly naive and trusting.
They are poor negotiators and lack the desire to influence others
(Kirkpatrick &amp; Locke, 1991).
</P><P>  The revised model below shows the effect of the high Machiavellian
personality type on the relationship between an individual's
motivation source and the choice of influence tactic used.
</P><P>  Machiavellian personality would decrease the relationship between
motivation sources and soft influence tactics, while increasing the
relationship between motivation sources and hard influence tactics.
Machiavellians will override their own motivation sources in order to
achieve their personal goals.
</P><P>  For example, if a high Machiavellian personality had high
self-concept external motivation, he or she might be expected to use
influence tactics such as coalitions, personal appeals, or inspirational
appeals (Barbuto &amp; Scholl, 1999). However, because high
Machiavellian individuals can easily alter their behaviors, they may use
a variety of influence tactics deemed necessary to achieve their goals.
In instances where Machiavellianism is high, a weakened relationship
between the individual's motivation source and influence tactics is
expected.
</P><P>  Therefore, those highly skilled in manipulation and influence to
achieve their personal goals will be very difficult to distinguish from
those who are simply focused on the goals of the organization. A skilled
Machiavellian will be able to appear to others as genuinely concerned
with others. Low Machiavellians, by contrast, would not alter their use
of influence tactics because they would not see the need to do so.
</P><P>  Proposition 8A: High Machiavellian personality will decrease the
relationship between a leader's motivation source and influence
tactic used.
</P><P>  Proposition 8B: Low Machiavellian personality will increase the
relationship between a leader's motivation source and influence
tactic used.
</P><P>  Discussion
</P><P>  In this paper, we have articulated a framework for understanding
the relationships among motivation, Machiavellianism, and influence
tactics. The framework explores the simple dispositional relationship
between sources of motivation and influence tactics, with several
expected relationships identified. While these relationships have been
examined empirically, with mixed results, it is prudent to consider them
further when examining this framework.
</P><P>  A more substantive contribution of this framework is its
exploration of the moderating effects of the Machiavellian personality
on the relationship between motivation and influence tactics. If
moderating effects were found, as expected, this would offer some
explanation for the mixed results found in past studies of the
relationship between motivation and influence tactics used.
</P><P>  Finally, this paper makes a second potent contribution with its
exploration of the direct relationship between Machiavellianism and
influence tactic choice in initial and subsequent influence attempts.
This relationship has been studied (Grams &amp; Rogers, 1989), but not
using established constructs or measures. The framework developed herein
provides the structure for a thoughtful research inquiry.
</P><P>  The paper features a review and extension of the motivation,
influence, and Machiavellian personality literatures. Previous research
on influence tactics and the Machiavellian personality has not
demonstrated or articulated the role of situational variables and their
effect on this relationship. In past operationalizations, the
Machiavellian disposition has been overly simplified to describe such
leaders as power-hungry individuals who do not consider the needs of
others and consistently act in an antagonistic, forceful, and unethical
manner. Through this paper, a more accurate depiction of the
Machiavellian personality is offered. Machiavellian personalities first
seek to influence using charm, friendliness, and tact. When these
influence attempts fail, Machiavellians exhibit influence behaviors more
consistent with previous definitions of the term.
</P><P>  Several propositions have been developed in this paper using
Barbuto and Scholl's (1998; 1999) operationalization of motivation
and Yukl and colleagues' (Falbe &amp; Yukl, 1992; Yukl &amp; Falbe,
1990; Yukl &amp; Tracey, 1992) conceptualization of influence tactics.
Individuals' intrinsic process motivation will be positively
related to their use of soft influence tactics (ingratiation, personal
appeals, and consultative) and one of the hard tactics (legitimating).
Individuals' instrumental motivation will be positively related to
their use of hard tactics such as exchange, pressure, coalitions, and
legitimating. Individuals' self-concept external motivation will be
positively related to their use of select soft and hard tactics
(coalitions, personal appeals, and ingratiation). Individuals'
self-concept external motivation will be positively related to their use
of such soft tactics as inspirational appeals and consultative tactics.
And, finally, individuals' goal internalization motivation will be
positively related to their use of soft tactics such as inspirational
appeals and consultative.
</P><P>  The framework articulates the role that Machiavellianism plays in
these proposed relationships. Generally speaking, the relationships
proposed will have a positive, moderating effect. Finally, we proposed
an ordinal relationship between a Machiavellian personality and use of
soft and hard tactics during initial and secondary influence attempts.
During initial influence attempts, Machiavellian personality will be
positively related to the use of soft influence tactics. During
subsequent influence attempts, Machiavellian personality will be
positively related to hard influence tactics. Because high Machiavellian
personalities are aware of the need to alter behavior given situational
factors, a proposition is made that the high Machiavellian personality
will increase the relationship between motivation source and influence
tactic used. In contrast, the low Machiavellian personality does not see
the need to alter behavior in relation to the situation. Therefore, a
final proposition in this paper expects that Machiavellian personality
will have a negative moderating effect on the relationships between a
leader's motivation source and influence tactic used. In the
framework, it is expected that as Machiavellian personality increases,
the relationship between motivation and influence tactics decreases.
</P><P>  The propositions developed in this review need to be subjected to
empirical inquiry. The moderating effects of Machiavellianism will need
to be measured and assessed in the relationship between motivation
sources and influence tactics used. Future research also might
investigate additional personality variables such as self-monitoring
(Snyder, 1974) and Jungian personality theories (Jung, 1971). In
addition, an examination of how the organizational context mitigates
influence, regardless of the tactic used to influence, seems prudent.
</P><P>  The thoughts of Machiavelli, although nearly 500 years old, still
contribute significantly to our perception of influence. Without a keen
understanding of how to modify other's thoughts, beliefs, and
behaviors, as well as one's own, many potential leaders might lose
their "kingdoms." And so, we leave you with a final quote that
embodies the essence of the framework developed in this paper.
</P><P>  "A certain Prince of our own days, whose name it is well as
not to mention, is always preaching peace and good faith, although the
mortal enemy of both; had he practiced them as he preaches them, would,
oftener than once, have lost him his kingdom and authority"
(Machiavelli, 1513/1902, p. 82).

Table 1. Definitions of Influence Tactics

Tactic           Behaviors

Pressure         Uses demands, threats, or intimidation to convince
                 others to comply with a request or to support a
                 proposal.
Legitimating     Seeks to persuade others that the request is something
                 they should comply with given their situation or
                 position.
Exchange         Makes explicit or implicit a promise that others will
                 receive rewards or tangible benefits if they comply
                 with a request, or reminds others of a favor that
                 should be reciprocated.
Coalition        Seeks the aid of others to persuade them to do some-
                 thing or uses the support of others as an argument for
                 them to agree.
Ingratiating     Seeks to get others in a good mood or to think favo-
                 rably of them before asking them to do something.
Rational         Uses logical arguments and factual evidence to per-
Persuasion       suade others that a proposal or request is viable and
                 likely to result in task objectives.
Inspirational    Makes an emotional request or proposal that arouses
Appeals          enthusiasm by appealing to others' values and ideals,
                 or by increasing their confidence that they can
                 succeed.
Consultation     Seeks others' participation in making a decision or
                 planning how to implement a proposed policy, strategy
                 or change.
Personal         Seeks others' compliance to their request by asking a
Appeals          "special favor for them," or by relying on interper-
                 sonal relationships to influence their behavior.
