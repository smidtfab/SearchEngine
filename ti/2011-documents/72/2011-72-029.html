<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><img src="basicGalTypes.jpg" alt="The two basic types of galaxies: bulge and disk" width="274" height="108" class="right" />You have seen in the lectures that galaxy structures come in two main flavors: galaxies with a dominant <strong>bulge</strong> (left), and galaxies with dominant <strong>disks</strong> (right).&nbsp;&nbsp;The structures of these galaxies are a rich source of information about how the galaxy evolved: galaxies with dominant disks are thought to have evolved in relative isolation; galaxies with dominant bulges may have undergone interactions with other galaxies that randomized and disrupted the disks (or formed at earlier times, when interactions were more common).&nbsp;&nbsp; In this lab, we will explore the structures of galaxies from a large sky survey, compare other properties with their structures, and contribute to an international research project.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Sloan&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;Sky&nbsp;Survey&nbsp;(SDSS)&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;using&nbsp;a dedicated&nbsp;telescope to perform an&nbsp;optical&nbsp;and&nbsp;spectroscopic&nbsp;survey&nbsp;of&nbsp;much&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;During&nbsp;the&nbsp;course of the project, the SDSS&nbsp;has&nbsp;imaged&nbsp;over&nbsp;930,000&nbsp;galaxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification of these galaxies to learn about their structures (bulges, disks, bars and spiral arms, and interacting galaxies), is important, but impossible for small teams of astronomers to do alone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 2007, an online project called the Galaxy Zoo was created to allow members of the public to help classify galaxies from the SDSS.&nbsp; Users of the site are presented with an image of a galaxy and are asked a series of questions, designed to differentiate smooth round galaxies from structured disk galaxies, estimate the prominence of a bulge component, and characterize any features such as spiral arms or bars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to note, Galaxy Zoo asks you to classify galaxies as either smooth or as having as disk or feature.  In general, all galxies that are smooth will be bulge galaxies, however, you could also have a bulge type galaxy that appears to have a dust lane or other feature.  These are somewhat rare, but you could come across one or two while doing your classifications, so be careful about taking notes as you go!

<p><u>In order to do this activity, you need to register for an account &ndash; some of the information required for this lab exercise is inaccessible without registering!</u><br />
  Please register before class at:<br />

  All that is needed is a username, e-mail address and password.</p>
You may wish to go through the tutorial when you register to save some time in class.
<h2>Part 1: Background and Preparation</h2>
<p>In general, galaxies with a dominant bulge have less cold gas and fewer blue stars than galaxies with a dominant disk. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Based on your recollection of stellar populations from earlier in the semester, which color of stars will have a shorter main sequence lifetime &ndash; blue or red? <br class="answer" />
  <br class="answer" /></li>
  <li>In the light of your answer, does it make sense that one type of galaxy would have both cold gas and blue stars, but another type would have neither?&nbsp; Explain your reasoning, and check your answer with your neighbor.<br class="answer" />
  <br class="answer" />
  <br class="answer" /></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Galaxy Zoo effort has involved over 150,000 volunteers so far. Having such a large number of users can be an advantage for several reasons.</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Why is it important to have more than one person classify the shape and features of each galaxy in Galaxy Zoo?<br class="answer" />
    <br class="answer" />
  <br class="answer" />
  <br class="answer" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Go over the tutorial with everyone in your group to make sure everyone understands how Galaxy Zoo classifies things.<br />
<a href="http://galaxyzoo.org/how_to_take_part">http://galaxyzoo.org/how_to_take_part</a></p>
<h2 class="break">Part 2: Classify some galaxies</h2>
<p>Have one person in your group <em>log in</em> and go to<br />
  <a href="http://galaxyzoo.org/classify">http://galaxyzoo.org/classify</a></p>
<p>For the first part of the lab exercise, you will classify 10 galaxies using the Galaxy Zoo website and record some of your observations in table 1. </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>In the <strong>color</strong> column, record the color as R for red or B for blue. Color is sometimes hard to determine &ndash; many &lsquo;red&rsquo; galaxies that appear yellow or orange.&nbsp; For the purposes of this exercise, any galaxy <em>without</em> an obvious blue portion is &lsquo;red&rsquo;, and galaxies <em>with</em> an obvious blue portion are &lsquo;blue&rsquo;. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>type</strong> column, record an S for &ldquo;smooth and rounded&rdquo;, D for &ldquo;features or disk&rdquo; or A for &ldquo;Star or artifact&rdquo; (this is the first step n the Galaxy Zoo classification.)</li>
  <li>For galaxies you record as D (&ldquo;features or disk&rdquo;): In the <strong>Edge or Face on Disk </strong>column record E if it is an edge on disk, F if it appears to be a face on disk (such as a spiral), or N if it is not actually a disk (e.g. it is smooth except for a dust lane). </li>
  <li>For all the galaxies where you recorded an N in the Edge or Face on Disk column, record whether it appears to be a bulge or disk galaxy, and explain why you think it is that type. For the other galaxies, record any notes about the galaxy, especially if there is &ldquo;anything odd&rdquo; like a dust lane. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 3: analyze your results</h2>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Once you have finished filling in the table, add up the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Number of bulge galaxies: _______<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Number of red bulge galaxies: ______<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Number of disk galaxies: ______<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Number of red disk galaxies:__________<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Number of red disk galaxies that are face on: ______</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Using a calculator or Excel, perform the following calculations:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>What percentage of the galaxies are bulge type? ___________<br/><br/> </li>
   
      <li>What percentage of the galaxies are disks? ________<br/><br/></li>
      <li>What percentage of your bulge galaxies are red?&nbsp; _____________<br/><br/></li>
   
      <li>What percentage of your disk galaxies are red? ____________<br/><br/></li>
      <li>What percentage of red disks are face-on?_______</li></ol></li>
