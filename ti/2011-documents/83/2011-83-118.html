In our case, we solve these problems by giving only one trusted person access to the results of our efforts. Since it's her thread and no one is more trusted around here I expect, I nominate Jessamyn. Find a balloon? Tell Jessamyn. No one else needs to know (especially no one needs to post about it on Metafilter).<br />
<br />
There shouldn't be any posting about NOT finding balloons either. And there is, now that I think of it, a role for active googlers looking to leverage the results of online communities that aren't as careful.<br />

that's nice of you to say, but IMO it should be someone with a little more name recognition, and jessamyn would be a better choice.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/41973" target="_self">Kwine</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806345" target="_self">2:52 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 </span></div><br><br>

Lol.  Don't tell 4chan or the Something Awful Goons, or there is a very good chance this will actually happen.

<a name="2806358"></a><div class="comments">I've been thinking about this since I first read the announcement.  It's really needle-in-haystack territory, for anything except a <i>really large</i> team.  But the problem with a really large team is that the prize money no longer functions as much of a motivator.  (And if you did try to motivate a lot of people — talking thousands here — with something relatively small like $40k, you're going to get nasty competition for a bigger slice of the pie.)<br />
<br />
I think the winning solution is for a team/organizer to step up and say what they'd like to do with the prize, and then encourage people to participate not for the money, but for geek cred and ideological reasons.  This is the approach that (IIRC) has been taken with some of the cryptographic challenges broken by distributed computation.  The people providing the bulk of the resources were never in it for the money; they were doing it for the technical challenge and warm fuzzy feeling of just participating.<br />
<br />
You can't afford to buy the participation of a large team of people, but you can easily get them to donate their time and effort if you ask just right.

DoS attacks don't attempt to perfectly emulate real traffic - they just suck up cycles and prevent the victim from getting stuff done. 10 fake balloons in an area means teams need to investigate 10x as many balloons before finding the real one. If the attackers who planted the balloons already know which balloons are fake they save a lot of time. The massively distributed nature of the exercise makes this type of attack less effective though because you need to have a lot of people involved to even attempt the task in the first place.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/26572" target="_self">GuyZero</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806364" target="_self">3:01 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 [<a href="/favorited/2/2806364" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I suspect that if someone is willing to sit around in a suit and plant a fake balloon in a large metro area, you're going to screw up an overwhelming majority of the teams. Plant one single person in Manhattan, DC, LA and San Francisco (or other areas where people have heard of Twitter and know how to self-organize online), and you've screwed up every single team, as this game is going to require national coverage and that team probably has <b>many</b> people in those cities.

<br />
I'm not sure if DARPA is expecting it to work out like that, but espionage and misinformation would really be some of the best methods in this kind of competition.  A naive strategy for winning would be to gather up as many people as possible, collect sightings, and share the results.<br />
<br />
But what if a ton of people join the group and submit fake sightings (which would be fairly easy to do)?  You'd have to independently verify them, and if you aren't careful about that you could accept verifications from the same group of people who submitted the fake sightings.  And if you let a lot of people see the probable/verified coordinates, what is stopping them from stealing that information and combining it with the findings from other teams that they have infiltrated, to eventually beat you to the punch?  It's very possible that the team to win this challenge will be the best at stealing information from other teams, and that the teams that were the best at actually finding the balloons will not end up winning.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/63307" target="_self">burnmp3s</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806384" target="_self">3:11 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 </span></div><br><br>

The advantage of a good fake balloon (i.e., one with a convincing crew of DARPA reps) could be that it fools people into thinking they've found the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> balloon so that they stop early.

amuseDetachment, it's unclear why that will screw up teams-any team sufficiently large and motivated to have a chance will be smart enough to just collect all reported balloon locations and let DARPA sort out the fakes from the reals. Maybe the winning team submits 1000 locations and 990 of them are fake?<br />
<br />
In terms of having LULZ, there's little advantage in sabotage, because there's no reason why any individual should assume that there's only one balloon (or only eight balloons) in their search area. Just keep pinging your search areas and reporting in if you find anything. In terms of trying to win the competition, there's no advantage gained in sabotage, it seems to me: those resources would be better spent looking for balloons, real or fake.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/41973" target="_self">Kwine</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806403" target="_self">3:21 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 </span></div><br><br>

Assuming no buildings, we should be able to come up with a map of the distance everyone sees if they step outside and look around.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling there's a critical point in which you have X amount of people looking over the continental US and you have a high percent chance of spotting the 8 balloons, which is what DARPA is going for. I would also bet that if you had an amount some arbitrary number larger than X, let's just say 2X the time it takes to detect the balloons does not decrease proportionally. Simply, even if you had a Facebook group with everyone in the continental US participating, you're not going to see better results than if you were the size of something like Metafilter.<br />
<br />
Of course I have no idea how we'd setup an entity to register for the contest and handle the funds. The real winner of this might not be some group of spotters, but a dedicated group that watches social media and discovers the balloons other, non-registered participants have found.

Also, I spent a lot of time driving the &quot;publicly accessible&quot; roads in Western Montana. Hiding an 8 foot balloon so that's it easy to see from a mountain road in the deep wilderness, but nearly impossible to see from the air, would be trivial. I wonder how hard they're really trying to hide them. Part of the challenge may be making sure you can find out if some local hiker tells a crazy story about a guy in the woods with a weather balloon at the coffee shop.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/524" target="_self">y6y6y6</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806423" target="_self">3:32 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 [<a href="/favorited/2/2806423" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Here's an email that I sent to the contest email address to decide this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a question about the balloon submission rules, in the context of possible sabotage of the contest by outside parties. Is there a limit to the number of balloon locations that I can submit? If I submit 1000 locations and 990 of them were fake but 10 were real, would that be an acceptable way to win the contest?<br />
<br />
If I have ten and only ten locations that I am allowed to submit, I'm concerned about authentication. How can I verify that nefarious parties haven't bought their own red balloons, staffed them with fake DARPA agents, etc? What will separate a &quot;real deal&quot; DARPA balloon from an impostor? <br />

This assumes the balloons would be placed in areas likely to have people using Twitter. Taking Montana as an example again - Once you get out of the cities you have a a vast area where people a) don't use Twitter at all, b) mind their own business when they see something weird, and c) are much more likely to tell the story in a bar or diner than anywhere else.<br />
<br />
If I was DARPA I'd build a map showing all Twitter/Facebook/Google user locations. Then I'd put many of the balloons where there were no dots. Think DARPA doesn't have that map already compiled somewhere?<br />

Just putting the balloons where Twitter and 4chan will find them would make the contest pointless.

I'm not seeing how to pull the information on members who logged in at least once in the last 3 mos. and who give a lat/lon in their profile.

<br />
Trying to win this with a secure, closed group is going to be very tricky; it is far too easy for someone to infiltrate an online group and feed in false information. It's much smarter to assume you'll be receiving false positives and develop a robust system that can assign reliabilities to each report.<br />

Cash award to correct reporters will not work. On my blog post, the <a href="http://mssv.net/2009/10/31/how-to-win-the-darpa-network-challenge/#comment-176339">first comment</a> was from someone offering &quot;at least $1000 for verified reports&quot;. Only <a href="http://mssv.net/2009/10/31/how-to-win-the-darpa-network-challenge/#comment-176412">three comments later</a> was an offer for $3000 for verified reports. It's an arms race no-one wins.<br />
<br />
Money is not going to be a primary motivation here; charity, or perhaps kudos, is. I can imagine a large group of people getting together to donate the prize to charity - in fact, many of the groups are <a href="http://redballoon.wikispaces.com/Groups">already promising to do so</a>. Another possibility is a large company or organisation (e.g. Google) deciding to throw a bit of cash behind an effort in order to get some good publicity.<br />

I see a lot of people casually talking about monitoring Twitter and Facebook to win. It is very sad to see this, because it will be an enormous waste of time; just wait until December 5th, and I guarantee you there will be thousands if not hundreds of thousands of false reports on every channel you can think of.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/482" target="_self">adrianhon</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806481" target="_self">4:20 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 [<a href="/favorited/2/2806481" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I think the smart way to do a cash award is to make each first correct report a lottery ticket for the full $40,000.

<a name="2806507"></a><div class="comments">Interesting.  I'm trying to think through the feasability of mustering a mefi-only effort, and these are the things jumping out to me:<br />
<br />
- raw size of source group (i.e. the mefi userbase) is not as important as distribution.  1000 people in the US and 900 of them in NYC (FIGURE NOT TO SCALE) is not much more help than 101 people in the US, 1 of them in NYC.<br />
<br />
- adrianhon's point about infiltration of a secure closed group is a reasonable one, but the question of enforcing security seems like the key thing there.  If the mefi team consists only of people who were already members of the site as of, say, a month ago, we reduce the likelihood of someone directly joining with infiltration in mind.  (Secondary weaknesses abound, but it's a good start.)<br />
<br />
- A group commitment to send the lump sum to a charitable third party mitigates the pay-for-play issues.  A trusted figurehead who can't afford to fuck everyone over obviates the solo-betrayal issue.  I'd be comfortable being that guy whose mefi life would be ruined by said ethical lapse, as far as that goes.<br />
<br />
- The plausibility of making it work, all else aside, comes down to the sheer volume of coverage we can muster.  So distribution + availability + mobility spells out raw sighting resources; some math should tell us how much road we can cover per hour, how much road needs covering, and most importantly how the covering of that road can be most efficiently (e.g. evenly) accomplished with the resources we have available.<br />
<br />
I suspect we could put together a pretty solidly designed and managed effort.  I'd be impressed if we managed a full eight sightings.  I'd be shocked if we were actually competitive for a win.  I think kicking ass and not winning is a totally acceptable idea.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/7418" target="_self">cortex</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806507" target="_self">4:39 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 [<a href="/favorited/2/2806507" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Restricting entry to people who signed up just before the competition was announced would absolutely help a lot, although I think we're all aware that there are plenty of spoilers amongst us ;) Still, it shouldn't be too difficult to work out a system to check and corroborate reports.

I think this is right; I also think it's a factor (maybe the only factor?) where we have a competitive advantage. We have a community that is remarkably diverse, for a web-based community, in terms of talent and geographical location. We have some built in controls to keep out the riff-raff (no one who joins after this was posted should get any access). We don't have any red tape, top down institutional bureaucracy that keeps us from getting off the ground in time. We're used to organizing together for little financial gain. We have loyalty to each other-we trust each other the way the SA Goons and 4chan fags(is that right? forgive me, I am not one of them) don't, for example.<br />
<br />
I really, REALLY believe that we're as well-positioned as any group out there to do this for little capital. If Google decides to jump in and spend a bunch of money to do it, good for them I guess, but to me that's outside the spirit of the thing. We just have to be better than everyone else, and I think we can be.<br />

Anyone with GIS knowledge, fast internet connection and programming skills could probably find all 10 location working alone pretty easily in a day or so.

Quick back of the envelope calculation: according to <a href="http://www.nationalatlas.gov/transportation.html">this</a> there are about 4 million highway miles in the US.  Assuming a full 6 hours of driving at 60 MPH, that means you would in theory need about 11,000 participants to conduct a full brute-force sweep.  I'm sure the actual number would be a lot higher because you can't achieve perfect efficiency of coverage.  Eleven thousand dedicated volunteers is nothing on the internet scale, however it is quite large on the scale of a single site -- unless you're talking about facebook.  But facebook suffers a different problem in that their massive resources will be splintered into countless factions.<br />

Several people have commented on the idea of whether there would be balloons placed in remote areas.  If that were the case it would bias the competition towards the teams that are focusing on shoe leather (i.e. going out and looking) and away from those that plan to infiltrate and/or google.  I tend to think that the focus of the contest is more on the social side than the actual physical act of searching side, which is why my guess is that they will all be hiding in plain sight of many people, i.e. in major metro areas near busy thoroughfares.  The real challenge then is not so much organizing teams to go out searching but rather to simply get word out to as many people as possible to know what to do if they see a red balloon during their normal Saturday activities.  If this theory is correct then it would be better to have a team of 5000 people who don't actually modify their Saturday behavior in any specific way but who are on the lookout and will report to their team if they see something, compared to a team of 1000 dedicated hunters who plan to spend the whole six hour window doing nothing but driving around looking.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/26222" target="_self">Rhomboid</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2806897" target="_self">11:26 PM</a>  on November 2, 2009 </span></div><br><br>

DARPA doesn't generally do &quot;easy&quot; challenges.  &quot;[R]eadily accessible locations and visible from nearby roadways&quot; covers a lot of territory.  &quot;Readily accessible&quot; could very easily mean a small farm road in the middle of rural Wyoming.  There's no reason to believe that it means &quot;readily accessible to internet readers in big cities on the coasts who don't own cars.&quot;  In fact, if the challenge is worth anything, it will force those people to expand their reach significantly in order to participate.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect a balloon to be placed on a 4-wheel-drive-only road in the mountains somewhere.  But I <em>would </em>expect several to placed on seldom-traveled two-lane paved roads in the mountains somewhere.  A balloon could be in the desert 50 miles in the distance from I-15 north of Barstow and visible only by someone with a very keen eye who is looking for it and not only fit the definition, but be a really obvious one, comparatively (since that's the general vicinity of other DARPA challenges).<br />
<br />
<em>Several people have commented on the idea of whether there would be balloons placed in remote areas.

I agree that the focus seems to be on the social side.  But that does not mean &quot;major metro areas near busy thoroughfares.&quot;  In fact, I think it would make a lot more sense to force the competition to include social and internet involvement of people in remote areas.  They have the internet in Ketchum, West Yellowstone, Munising, and Gallup, too.  Forcing teams to stretch their use of available social networks is something that I would expect DARPA to do.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I would be shocked if more than 2 or 3 of the balloons were in metropolitan areas - big or small.  I would also be shocked if <em>any </em>of them were visible from a busy thoroughfare.  If the idea is to celebrate the anniversary of the internet, it seems to me that demonstrating the incredible reach of the internet to remote areas would be an obvious part of that celebration.<br />
<br />
<em>Does anyone find it odd that the rules state the balloons will be on display from 10AM ET to 4PM local time? If read literally that means 7AM to 4PM in the pacific time zone.</em><br />
<br />
To me, it seems to say 10AM to 4PM local time to the balloon itself.  So the balloon could be in the front yard of a farm house on the outskirts of Firth, Idaho and the DARPA folks only have to stay with it during the day and can then travel to their lodgings for the night.  The timeframe suggests to me that they are definitely going to put the balloons in the middle of nowhere.<br />
<br />

A brute force sweep of the highways.  And there's no reason to believe that any of the balloons will be visible from any highway, is there?  I mean, the announcement says &quot;roadway,&quot; not &quot;highway.&quot;  They could be at the end of suburban cul-de-sacs.  The sheer vastness of the United States &quot;roadways,&quot; combined with the surprising reach of the internet into remote areas make the challenge much more interesting than if it was just a question of demonstrating that people in big cities can communicate with each other.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/51575" target="_self">The World Famous</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2807500" target="_self">11:24 AM</a>  on November 3, 2009 </span></div><br><br>

<br />
Pure speculation, but my guess is that the purpose of the competition is to measure/observe how information propagates via social networks, and also how people might assemble various bits and pieces of information from diverse sources into something &quot;actionable&quot; (list of the correct locations and only the correct locations).<br />
<br />
It seems like it has greater theoretical than immediately practical value, and would also explain the rather low prize payout compared to challenges with more immediate applications (e.g. self-driving cars).<br />

I thought of odinsdream's scenario (learning how the networks function so they could be disrupted) as well.   I don't think that's really tinfoil-hat category at all; knowing how to disrupt or feed bad information into a possible intelligence-gathering mechanism seems fairly logical.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/36800" target="_self">Kadin2048</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2807665" target="_self">12:55 PM</a>  on November 3, 2009 [<a href="/favorited/2/2807665" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="2807783"></a><div class="comments">If they meant 10AM in local time why didn't they just say that instead of &quot;10AM ET&quot;?  They went out of their way to specify the start and end times differently.  It just doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
<i>And there's no reason to believe that any of the balloons will be visible from any highway, is there?</i><br />
<br />
The reason is that they want it to have some small chance of this being doable.  If you take their suggestion literally to mean that it could be visible from anywhere that there's any kind of road then the chances of a team being able to get all ten goes down to vanishingly close to nil, at least with a paltry 40k budget.  As already mentioned their previous challenges had prizes on the order of a million dollars and I seem to recall that the winning teams spent something like 1.5x - 2x the prize amount (in other words, they wanted to win for the acclaim and the money was not a factor.)<br />
<br />
Actually, that 4 million miles figure might be a bit high.  I just checked the CIA world factbook and they list 2,615,870 miles paved and 1,401,791 miles unpaved (4,017,661 roadway miles total.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/26222" target="_self">Rhomboid</a> at <a href="/86326/And-here-is-a-red-balloon-I-think-of-DARPA-and-note-its-exact-coordinates#2807783" target="_self">2:17 PM</a>  on November 3, 2009 </span></div><br><br>
