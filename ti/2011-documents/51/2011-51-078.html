				<p>Google “TechTalks” consist of a series of invited speakers who discuss their expertise in the world of technology.  This TechTalk is by Luis Von Ahn, a graduate of both Duke University and Carnegie Mellon University, and a assistant professor at the latter.  Von Ahn is an expert in the field of computer science and is here discussing the idea of human computation, found at  HYPERLINK &#8220;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143#&#8221; http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143#.  Human computation is the process of using humans doing things for computers, such as identifying images or distorted messages, that their technology does not yet allow them to do.  In his talk, von Ahn suggests that instead of paying people to do these computations for computers, why not make humans want to do these tasks.  By incorporating social networking and gaming, he is able to do this.  Luis von Ahn suggests that by using simple, fun, and addictive games, human computation can be used to accurate label every image on the web at no cost to those who require the service.<br />
Currently, there is problem with the accessibility of the web.  For example, when you do a google search for “dog,” you get any picture that’s caption or file name is, or related to, the word “dog.”  This result could be anything from a picture of a person who likes dogs or a picture of a girl who’s aunt has a dog.  According to von Ahn, if we change this aspect of the web and change the accuracy of an image’s label, we will change the accessibility of the web.  In order to do this, von Ahn has created a game, the ESP Game, that’s end products are reliable labels for images provided by two independent sources.  The game shows an image to two players, and the players must agree on a label for this image.  Because the two players can not see what their partner is guessing, it is guaranteeing that the label is accurate.  Also, because it is a competitive game, the players have a tendency to work very fast.  So fast, in fact, that von Ahn has calculated that all the images on the web could be labeled in just 2 months by 5000 players playing simultaneously.  This feat is shockingly possible as well seeing that most games on popular gaming sites average about 5000 players at a time.<br />
Somewhere along the line, von Ahn discovered that there was a chance that people could cheat on the game.  For example, a group of people could decide to log on at the same time, be paired together, and label all the images “a” in order to get a high score.  However, this was simply solved by putting in test images, which has possible responses stored in a database.  If a player unsuccessful labels one of these images, he/she is booted from the game.  So now that the game is created and effective, where does the research go from here?  In the Q&amp;A after his talk, he is asked if there will ever be a time when a computer is faced with a problem, and there will be a game that it can go to for answers.  Von Ahn explains that this is most likely impossible seeing that we, as software designers, do not yet know all the problems a computer can and will face.  Until we understand all of these situations, computers will still need our help, even if it is as simple a task as identifying an image.<br />
In his talk, von Ahn also mentions two other “games with a purpose” similar to the ESP Game.  The first is called PeekaBoom.  This is a game where one player is shown an image and a word.  The player then clicks on a certain part of the image to be sent to his/her partner.  The partner receives this small portion of an image and guesses what it is.  When the partner’s guess matches the word that the first player has, they win and get points.  What this does is locates images within images for computers to then use.  So instead of having an entire image, a computer can pick out certain portions of an image.  The second game is called Verbosity.  The goal of this game is to get your partner to guess the word that you have on your screen by giving them clues.  When your partner guesses the word you get points and switch roles.  What this game does is gives us common sense facts about words, the clues, and they are then verified when the partner guesses the correct word.  These games, along with the ESP Game, are all part of a greater mission to mark the web more accessible, and they are well on their way.<br />
By incorporating human behavior and interests in his research, Luis von Ahn created a genius way to encourage human computation.  While it is very simple, his game brings out the competitive nature of humans, making it very addictive.  Because his game involves these aspects, it is capable of accurately labeling every picture on the web, making it more accessible, his ultimate goal.</p>
