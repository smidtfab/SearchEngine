<p><b>Introduction to Motivation</b></p>
</center>
<p>At one time, employees were considered just another input
into the production of goods and services. What perhaps changed
this way of thinking about employees was research, referred to as
the Hawthorne Studies, conducted by Elton Mayo from 1924 to 1932
(Dickson, 1973). This study found employees are not motivated
solely by money and employee behavior is linked to their
attitudes (Dickson, 1973). The Hawthorne Studies began the human
relations approach to management, whereby the needs and
motivation of employees become the primary focus of managers
(Bedeian, 1993).
<center>
<p><b>Motivation Theories</b></p>
</center>
<p>Understanding what motivated employees and how they were
motivated was the focus of many researchers following the
publication of the Hawthorne Study results (Terpstra, 1979).
Five major approaches that have led to our understanding of
motivation are Maslow's need-hierarchy theory, Herzberg's two-
factor theory, Vroom's expectancy theory, Adams' equity
theory, and Skinner's reinforcement theory.
<p>According to Maslow, employees have five levels of needs
(Maslow, 1943): physiological, safety, social, ego, and self-
actualizing. Maslow argued that lower level needs had to be
satisfied before the next higher level need would motivate
employees. Herzberg's work categorized motivation into two
factors: motivators and hygienes (Herzberg, Mausner, &amp; Snyderman,
1959). Motivator or intrinsic factors, such as achievement and
recognition, produce job satisfaction. Hygiene or extrinsic
factors, such as pay and job security, produce job
dissatisfaction.
<p>Vroom's theory is based on the belief that employee effort
will lead to performance and performance will lead to rewards
(Vroom, 1964). Rewards may be either positive or negative. The
more positive the reward the more likely the employee will be
highly motivated. Conversely, the more negative the reward the
less likely the employee will be motivated.
<p>Adams' theory states that employees strive for equity
between themselves and other workers. Equity is achieved when the
ratio of employee outcomes over inputs is equal to other employee
outcomes over inputs (Adams, 1965).
<p>Skinner's theory simply states those employees' behaviors
that lead to positive outcomes will be repeated and behaviors
that lead to negative outcomes will not be repeated (Skinner,
1953). Managers should positively reinforce employee behaviors
that lead to positive outcomes. Managers should negatively
reinforce employee behavior that leads to negative outcomes.
<center>
<p><b>Motivation Defined</b></p>
</center>
<p>Many contemporary authors have also defined the concept of
motivation. Motivation has been defined as:  the psychological
process that gives behavior purpose and direction (Kreitner,
1995); a predisposition to behave in a purposive manner to
achieve specific, unmet needs (Buford, Bedeian, &amp; Lindner, 1995);
an internal drive to satisfy an unsatisfied need (Higgins, 1994);
and the will to achieve (Bedeian, 1993). For this paper,
motivation is operationally defined as the inner force that
drives individuals to accomplish personal and organizational
goals.
<center>
<p><b>The Role of Motivation</b></p>
</center>
<p>Why do we need motivated employees? The answer is survival
(Smith, 1994). Motivated employees are needed in our rapidly
changing workplaces. Motivated employees help organizations
survive. Motivated employees are more productive. To be
effective, managers need to understand what motivates employees
within the context of the roles they perform. Of all the
functions a manager performs, motivating employees is arguably
the most complex. This is due, in part, to the fact that what
motivates employees changes constantly (Bowen &amp; Radhakrishna,
1991). For example, research suggests that as employees' income
increases, money becomes less of a motivator (Kovach, 1987).
Also, as employees get older, interesting work becomes more of a
motivator.
<center>
<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
</center>
<p>The purpose of this study was to describe the importance of
certain factors in motivating employees at the Piketon Research
and Extension Center and Enterprise Center. Specifically, the
study sought to describe the ranked importance of the following
ten motivating factors: (a) job security, (b) sympathetic help
with personal problems, (c) personal loyalty to employees, (d)
interesting work, (e) good working conditions, (f) tactful
discipline, (g) good wages, (h) promotions and growth in the
organization, (i) feeling of being in on things, and (j) full
appreciation of work done. A secondary purpose of the study was
to compare the results of this study with the study results from
other populations.
<center>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
</center>
<p>The research design for this study employed a descriptive
survey method. The target population of this study included
employees at the Piketon Research and Extension Center and
Enterprise Center (centers). The sample size included all 25
employees of the target population. Twenty-three of the 25
employees participated in the survey for a
participation rate of 92%. The centers are in Piketon, Ohio.
<p>The mission of the Enterprise Center is to facilitate
individual and community leader awareness and provide assistance
in preparing and accessing economic opportunities in southern
Ohio. The Enterprise Center has three programs: alternatives in
agriculture, small business development, and women's business
development. The mission of the Piketon Research and Extension
Center is to conduct research and educational programs designed
to enhance economic development in southern Ohio. The Piketon
Research and Extension Center has five programs: aquaculture,
community economic development, horticulture, forestry, and soil
and water resources.
<p>From a review of literature, a survey questionnaire was
developed to collect data for the study (Bowen &amp; Radhakrishna,
1991; Harpaz, 1990; Kovach, 1987). Data was collected through use
of a written questionnaire hand-delivered to participants.
Questionnaires were filled out by participants and returned to an
intra-departmental mailbox. The questionnaire asked participants
to rank the importance of ten factors that motivated them in
doing their work: 1=most important . . . 10=least important. Face
and content validity for the instrument were established using
two administrative and professional employees at The Ohio State
University. The instrument was pilot tested with three similarly
situated employees within the university. As a result of the
pilot test, minor changes in word selection and instructions were
made to the questionnaire.
<center>
<p><b>Results and Discussion</b></p>
</center>
<p>The ranked order of motivating factors were: (a) interesting
work, (b) good wages, (c) full appreciation of work done, (d) job
security, (e) good working conditions, (f) promotions and growth
in the organization, (g) feeling of being in on things, (h)
personal loyalty to employees, (i) tactful discipline, and (j)
sympathetic help with personal problems.
<p>A comparison of these results to Maslow's need-hierarchy
theory provides some interesting insight into employee
motivation. The number one ranked motivator, interesting work, is
a self-actualizing factor. The number two ranked motivator, good
wages, is a physiological factor. The number three ranked
motivator, full appreciation of work done, is an esteem factor.
The number four ranked motivator, job security, is a safety
factor. Therefore, according to Maslow (1943), if managers wish
to address the most important motivational factor of Centers'
employees, interesting work, physiological, safety, social, and
esteem factors must first be satisfied. If managers wished to
address the second most important motivational factor of centers'
employees, good pay, increased pay would suffice. Contrary to
what Maslow's theory suggests, the range of motivational factors
are mixed in this study. Maslow's conclusions that lower level
motivational factors must be met before ascending to the next
level were not confirmed by this study.
<p>The following example compares the highest ranked
motivational factor (interesting work) to Vroom's expectancy
theory. Assume that a Centers employee just attended a staff
meeting where he/she learned a major emphasis would be placed on
seeking additional external program funds. Additionally,
employees who are successful in securing funds will be given more
opportunities to explore their own research and extension
interests (interesting work). Employees who do not secure
additional funds will be required to work on research and
extension programs identified by the director. The employee
realizes that the more research he/she does regarding funding
sources and the more proposals he/she writes, the greater the
likelihood he/she will receive external funding.
<p>Because the state legislature has not increased
appropriations to the centers for the next two years (funds for
independent research and extension projects will be scaled back),
the employee sees a direct relationship between performance
(obtaining external funds) and rewards (independent research and
Extension projects). Further, the employee went to work for the
centers, in part, because of the opportunity to conduct
independent research and extension projects. The employee will be
motivated if he/she is successful in obtaining external funds and
given the opportunity to conduct independent research and
extension projects. On the other hand, motivation will be
diminished if the employee is successful in obtaining external
funds and the director denies the request to conduct independent
research and Extension projects.
<p>The following example compares the third highest ranked
motivational factor (full appreciation of work done) to Adams's
equity theory. If an employee at the centers feels that there is
a lack of appreciation for work done, as being too low relative
to another employee, an inequity may exist and the employee will
be dis-motivated. Further, if all the employees at the centers
feel that there is a lack of appreciation for work done, inequity
may exist. Adams (1965) stated employees will attempt to restore
equity through various means, some of which may be counter-
productive to organizational goals and objectives. For instance,
employees who feel their work is not being appreciated may work
less or undervalue the work of other employees.
<p>This final example compares the two highest motivational
factors to Herzberg's two-factor theory. The highest ranked
motivator, interesting work, is a motivator factor. The second
ranked motivator, good wages is a hygiene factor. Herzberg,
Mausner, &amp; Snyderman (1959) stated that to the degree that
motivators are present in a job, motivation will occur. The
absence of motivators does not lead to dissatisfaction. Further,
they stated that to the degree that hygienes are absent from a
job, dissatisfaction will occur. When present, hygienes prevent
dissatisfaction, but do not lead to satisfaction. In our example,
the lack of interesting work (motivator) for the centers'
employees would not lead to dissatisfaction. Paying centers'
employees lower wages (hygiene) than what they believe to be fair
may lead to job dissatisfaction. Conversely, employees will be
motivated when they are doing interesting work and but will not
necessarily be motivated by higher pay.
<p>The discussion above, about the ranked importance of
motivational factors as related to motivational theory, is only
part of the picture. The other part is how these rankings compare
with related research. A study of industrial employees, conducted
by Kovach (1987), yielded the following ranked order of
motivational factors: (a) interesting work, (b) full appreciation
of work done, and (c) feeling of being in on things. Another
study of employees, conducted by Harpaz (1990), yielded the
following ranked order of motivational factors: (a) interesting
work, (b) good wages, and (c) job security.
<p>In this study and the two cited above, interesting work
ranked as the most important motivational factor. Pay was not
ranked as one of the most important motivational factors by
Kovach (1987), but was ranked second in this research and by
Harpaz (1990). Full appreciation of work done was not ranked as
one of the most important motivational factors by Harpaz (1990),
but was ranked second in this research and by Kovach (1987). The
discrepancies in these research findings supports the idea that
what motivates employees differs given the context in which the
employee works. What is clear, however, is that employees rank
interesting work as the most important motivational factor.
<center>
<p><b>Implications for Centers and Extension</b></p>
</center>
<p>The ranked importance of motivational factors of employees
at the centers provides useful information for the centers'
director and employees. Knowing how to use this information in
motivating centers' employees is complex. The strategy for
motivating centers' employees depends on which motivation
theories are used as a reference point. If Hertzberg's theory is
followed, management should begin by focusing on pay and job
security (hygiene factors) before focusing on interesting work
and full appreciation of work done (motivator factors). If Adams'
equity theory is followed, management should begin by focusing on
areas where there may be perceived inequities (pay and full
appreciation of work done) before focusing on interesting work
and job security. If Vroom's theory is followed, management
should begin by focusing on rewarding (pay and interesting work)
employee effort in achieving organizational goals and objectives.
<p>Regardless of which theory is followed, interesting work and
employee pay appear to be important links to higher motivation of
centers' employees. Options such as job enlargement, job
enrichment, promotions, internal and external stipends, monetary,
and non-monetary compensation should be considered. Job
enlargement can be used (by managers) to make work more
interesting (for employees) by increasing the number and variety
of activities performed. Job enrichment can used to make work
more interesting and increase pay by adding higher level
responsibilities to a job and providing monetary compensation
(raise or stipend) to employees for accepting this
responsibility. These are just two examples of an infinite number
of methods to increase motivation of employees at the centers.
The key to motivating centers' employees is to know what
motivates them and designing a motivation program based on those
needs.
<p>The results presented in this paper also have implications
for the entire Cooperative Extension Sysyem. The effectiveness of
Extension is dependent upon the motivation of its employees
(Chesney, 1992; Buford, 1990; Smith, 1990). Knowing what
motivates employees and incorporating this knowledge into the
reward system will help Extension identify, recruit, employ,
train, and retain a productive workforce. Motivating Extension
employees requires both managers and employees working together
(Buford, 1993).  Extension employees must be willing to let
managers know what motivates them, and managers must be willing
to design reward systems that motivate employees. Survey results,
like those presented here, are useful in helping Extension
managers determine what motivates employees (Bowen &amp;
Radhakrishna, 1991). If properly designed reward systems are not
implemented, however, employees will not be motivated.
