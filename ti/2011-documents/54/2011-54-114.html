This is my first AAC&amp;U conference, and I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting faculty and staff interested in supporting learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m leading a session at the conference with my Vanderbilt colleague, Lily Claiborne. Lily&#8217;s a graduate teaching fellow at the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching and a doctoral student in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science. Well, actually, I&#8217;m not sure what her technical status in that department is since she defended her dissertation last week! Lily was also a participant in our Teaching-as-Research Fellows program a couple of years ago, a program we&#8217;ll be sharing in our session at #STEM11.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Teaching-as-Research Fellows: Encouraging Scientific Teaching</strong></p>
<p>The Teaching-as-Research Fellows program at Vanderbilt University, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cirtl.net">Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL)</a>, has helped current and future STEM faculty develop their abilities to assess and evaluate student learning. Supported by faculty mentors and CIRTL-affiliated staff, graduate student fellows conduct &#8220;teaching-as-research&#8221; (TAR) projects that explore aspects of undergraduate education. The fellows gain assessment skills useful in their future faculty work, the undergraduate curriculum benefits from the innovations developed through the fellows&#8217; projects, and the faculty mentors learn more about assessment practices along the way. Participants will learn about the program and discuss how to develop similar programs on their campuses.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read more about the TAR Fellows program and see past projects over <a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/programs/teaching-as-research-fellows-program/">on the Center for Teaching website</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re heading to the #STEM11 conference, too, give me a shout!</p>

<div class="postContent"><p class="syndicated-attribution"><i>Syndicated from <a href="http://derekbruff.com/teachingwithcrs">Teaching with Classroom Response Systems</a></i></p>
<p><a href="http://derekbruff.com/teachingwithcrs/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/banner3-postcard.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-927" title="Connected Summit" src="http://derekbruff.com/teachingwithcrs/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/banner3-postcard-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" /></a>Earlier this month, Abilene Christian University hosted the <a href="http://www.acu.edu/technology/mobilelearning/conferences/summit/index.html">Connected Summit</a>, a conference for K12, college, and university educators and administrators interested in the role of mobile devices (including, but not limited to, the iPhone and the iPad) in education. I was, unfortunately, not able to attend the conference, but I did participate actively on the Twitter backchannel organized around the hashtag #acuconnected.</p>
<p>During the first day of the conference, most of the discussion on the backchannel seemed to be around the use of mobile devices as content delivery mechanisms: e-books, open educational resources, and the like. It&#8217;s certainly a challenge to create content that works well on these platforms, and there&#8217;s definite potential in mobile content delivery to improve aspects of education. But I wasn&#8217;t entirely happy with this focus on only content delivery. This tweet from Mark van &#8216;t Hooft (<a href="http://twitter.com/dutchboyinohio">@dutchboyinohio</a>) motivated me to jump in the backchannel and comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>ACU should focus on learning outside of classroom and how to connect it to classroom learning. Learning exp should be 24/7 <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s my two-part reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/dutchboyinohio">dutchboyinohio</a> Not sure I buy that. Transforming what happens *in* class is where there&#8217;s potential for growth. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p>
<p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/dutchboyinohio">dutchboyinohio</a> Students already have lots of access to tech outside of class, esp. on residential campuses. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Mark van &#8216;t Hooft continued the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/derekbruff">derekbruff</a> Right,but what do they do with them 4 learning? <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So I clarified:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/dutchboyinohio">dutchboyinohio</a> My point is that (perhaps) mobile doesn&#8217;t add much to the out-of-class experience that&#8217;s not already available <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p>
<p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/dutchboyinohio">dutchboyinohio</a> It does, however, open up lots of new options for changing what happens in class. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It felt productive to have that interchange, to point towards the use of mobile devices in the classroom itself. But as the backchannel started on the second day of the conference, there continued to be a focus on content delivery. I decided that if no one else was going to direct people&#8217;s attention beyond just content delivery, I would:</p>
<blockquote><p>Content delivery is fine, but I&#8217;m more interested in what you can&#8217;t do *without* mobility. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>My new sparring partner Mark van &#8216;t Hooft wrote back:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/derekbruff">derekbruff</a>: &#8220;Mobile learning *in* the classroom&#8221;: sounds like an oxymoron to me&#8230;. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Those were, to me, fighting words!</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/dutchboyinohio">dutchboyinohio</a> When stdts walk into class w/powerful, connected computers in their pockets, class can work very differently! <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It occurred to me that some, perhaps many at the conference were using a definition of &#8220;mobile learning&#8221; very different from mine. As I noted in my post, &#8220;<a href="http://derekbruff.com/teachingwithcrs/?p=355">Five Types of Mobile Learning</a>,&#8221; back in 2009, some take the &#8220;mobile&#8221; in &#8220;mobile learning&#8221; to modify the <em>student</em>. If the students need to be mobile, then I can see why mobile learning in the classroom might sound like an oxymoron. But if it&#8217;s the <em>devices</em> that are mobile, then classroom uses of iPads, iPhones, and the like are back on the table.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not alone in my definition of mobile learning. Check out this short video of Bill Rankin, director of educational innovation at ACU, talking about the potential of mobile devices to transform what happens <em>in</em> the classroom:</p>
<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/D9k7O7ep2Yk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/D9k7O7ep2Yk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s not talking about content delivery here, at least not in the sense of delivering educational content to mobile devices when students are out and about. As I mentioned in my tweets, I think that mobile devices can transform that kind of out-of-classroom learning, but they have even greater potential to enhance what goes on in the classroom.</p>
<p>Here are those five types of mobile learning again:</p>
<ol>
<li>“<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TeachingWithClassroomResponseSystems/~3/?p=44">Super-clickers</a>” allowing for multiple-choice as well as free-response questions during class</li>
<li>Tools for student-to-student communication and collaboration during class (e.g. <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TeachingWithClassroomResponseSystems/~3/?cat=80">backchannel discussion</a>)</li>
<li>Portals to the world outside of the class (e.g. <a href="http://www.educause.edu/library/ELI7014?redir">Google jockeys</a>)</li>
<li>Mobile platforms for delivering content (lecture notes, videos, texts, etc.) anywhere students happen to be</li>
<li>Tools for collecting and analyzing data (interviews, photos, scientific data, etc.) while out in the field</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that types 1, 2, and 3 happen during class, not outside of it. These activities are difficult-to-impossible to facilitate without student mobile devices of some kind&#8211;laptops, cell phones, smart phones, tablets. That&#8217;s what I meant when I tweeted &#8220;I&#8217;m more interested in what you can&#8217;t do *without* mobility.&#8221; These powerful, connected devices have the potential to turn our students&#8217; classroom experiences into <a href="http://derekbruff.com/teachingwithcrs/?p=597">events they don&#8217;t want to miss</a>. Let&#8217;s not leave this potential out of our discussions of mobile learning!</p>
<p>Two other points about mobile learning:</p>
<p>One, I&#8217;m open to adding &#8220;<a href="http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2011/sections/augmented-reality/">augmented reality</a>&#8221; to that list as a sixth type of mobile learning. It involves mobile content delivery, but the interactive and place-based aspects of augmented reality means it&#8217;s more than just that.</p>
<p>Two, when we focus on mobile learning&#8217;s potential outside of the classroom, I&#8217;m not sure content delivery is the &#8220;killer app&#8221; anyway. Gary Olds (<a href="http://twitter.com/goldsatwork">@GoldsAtWork</a>) tweeted the following, reporting on a presentation by Lousie Duncan at the ACU conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mobile learning is bite sized, context aware, spontaneous personal, pervasive, informal, portable, opportunistic  -<a title="#LouiseDuncan" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23LouiseDuncan">#LouiseDuncan</a><a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I buy that, but that list is missing something. I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/GoldsAtWork">GoldsAtWork</a> Isn&#8217;t mobile learning also social? Connected? Collaborative? <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I use my Android phone for social networking (via Twitter and Facebook) more than anything. And I suspect that most of our students use their phones for social activities more than consuming content. Larry Rosen <a href="http://bwatwood.edublogs.org/2011/02/26/sorta-like-the-sky/">reports</a> in his book <em>Rewired: Understanding the iGeneration and the Way They Learn </em>that 16-to-18-year-olds spend an average of 3.5 hours texting a day. I&#8217;m guessing they watch some YouTube videos on their phones, too, but&#8230; 3.5 hours?! That&#8217;s incredible. Focusing on content delivery again misses the potential of these devices.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another tweet from me from the second day of the conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do students use mobile devices? For consuming content? Or for interacting socially? <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Trent Gillaspie (<a href="http://twitter.com/trentbbmobile">@TrentBbMobile</a>) got my point and responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/derekbruff">derekbruff</a> both again. Without content creation by students on mobile, consumption loses so much value. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Me again:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/TrentBbMobile">TrentBbMobile</a> Re: content creation. That&#8217;s why mlearning needs to focus on the interactive &amp; the social. Not just delivery. <a title="#acuconnected" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23acuconnected">#acuconnected</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Mobile is social, and those interested in mobile learning should keep that in mind.</p>

<p>The great people at the Center for New Designs in Learning &amp; Scholarship (CNDLS), who hosted my visit to Georgetown University last month, have not only posted videos of both of my talks there, but they&#8217;ve also excerpted portions of those talks focusing on particular topics and made those excerpts available online, too.</p>
<p>From my first talk, &#8220;Classtime Reconsidered: Motivating Student Participation and Engagement,&#8221; they&#8217;ve shared a 6-minute clip on <strong>times for telling:</strong></p>

<div class="postContent"><p><a href="http://derekbruff.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jelly-beans.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-824" title="jelly beans" src="http://derekbruff.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jelly-beans-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>Last night I led a workshop titled &#8220;Leveraging Diversity: The Wisdom of Crowds in University Teaching.&#8221; My goal in the workshop was to explore ways to use crowdsourcing in the college classroom to leverage the various kinds of diversity (cultural, cognitive, affective) we see in our students. There are many great resources out there on being respectful of diversity in the classroom, that is, on inclusive teaching, but fewer resources on taking advantage of student diversity to create more effective learning environment. Given <a href="http://derekbruff.com/site/blog/tag/cognitive-surplus/">what I&#8217;ve been reading lately</a> about crowdsourcing, I wanted to see if the &#8220;wisdom of crowds&#8221; idea might provide some helpful tools.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/2011/02/leveraging-diversity-in-the-classroom-some-resources/">my blog post</a> on the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching blog for the Prezi I used as well as details on the examples of crowdsourcing activities I mentioned in the workshop. Here on my personal blog, I thought I would pull back the curtain a bit and talk about how I facilitated this session. There was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nnoakes/status/40215137659006976">at least some interest</a> on Twitter in hearing more about the structure of the session beyond what&#8217;s visible in the Prezi!</p>
<p>We started the workshop with brief introductions. I then framed the topic a bit, noting that my use of the term &#8220;diversity&#8221; would include not only cultural or identify diversity, but cognitive and affective diversity, as well. I then used a couple of quotes from James Surowiecki (<em>The Wisdom of Crowds) </em>and Scott Page (<em>The Difference)</em> to make the argument that more diverse groups are often better problem-solvers than less diverse groups, even when the less diverse groups consist of experts in the domain. What Surowiecki and Page don&#8217;t claim is that diverse groups of students can learn more effectively than less diverse groups. That&#8217;s the argument I wanted to make in the workshop.</p>
<p>After that introduction, I wanted the workshop participants to experience the wisdom of crowds. I did so in two ways. First, I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/derekbruff/status/40169213830250496">asked my friends on Twitter</a> to respond to the question &#8220;What are some strategies for encouraging students with minority  viewpoints to contribute to face-to-face or online class discussions?&#8221; I told the workshop participants that I would share those responses later in the session.</p>
<p>Then I passed around a jar of jelly beans and asked the participants to <strong>guess how many jelly beans were in the jar</strong>. Each participant submitted his or her guess on an index card independently. Then I told the participants that they had to come up with a guess as a group. While I entered their individual guesses in a spreadsheet, the 18 participants started discussing the question and trying to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>There were 1,048 jelly beans in the jar. The average of the individual guesses was 899, not too far off. The group&#8217;s consensus guess was 700, not quite as good. The best individual guess was 1,027, remarkably accurate.  (The worst was 5,000&#8230;) After sharing these data, I had the participants debrief the experience of coming to a group consensus. What did I want them to come away from this experience with?</p>
<ul>
<li>The crowd is often smarter than any one individual. In this case, we had two guesses (1,027 and 1,000) that were better than the average of the individual guesses, but the average was better than all the rest of the individual guesses.</li>
<li>For a problem like this, having the members of the crowd work independently is usually better than having them collaborate. During the debrief, we talked about reasons why this is the case. Some individuals didn&#8217;t feel like their guesses were very good, so they didn&#8217;t contribute to the group discussion. Others didn&#8217;t know how many in the group agreed with them, which also inhibited their contributions. And some noted that a couple of leaders emerged during the discussion, which helped move the discussion along but also perhaps biased the discussion in certain ways.</li>
<li>Although getting the right answer might benefit from independent work, learning from each other does not. Some participants mentioned how they reconsidered their personal jelly-bean-counting strategies after hearing in the discussion how others had approached the problem. This particular question had a definite answer, but since there were multiple ways to approach the question, it lent itself to productive discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this bit of experiential learning, I shared some concrete examples of crowdsourcing, some from educational settings, some from other settings. See <a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/2011/02/leveraging-diversity-in-the-classroom-some-resources/">my CFT blog post</a> for the details.</p>
<p>The tool that probably received the most interest was the <strong>prediction market</strong>. We discussed a few great types of questions for use with prediction markets in the classroom (questions related to current events, questions related to the outcomes of experiments or design problems, questions asking students to predict the average grade on an upcoming exam), and I&#8217;m now eager to see how I might use prediction markets in my cryptography seminar next fall. What I don&#8217;t know at this point is what kind of Web services are available to implement prediction markets. If you know of any free and/or open-source prediction market platforms, please let me know!</p>
<p>After showing participants several different examples of crowdsourcing activities, I then asked them to do a little crowdsourcing themselves. Instead of sharing with them what I saw as the key principles for turning a crowdsourcing activity into a learning activity, I asked them to identify those principles. I gave each participant a couple of 4&#8243; x 8&#8243; Post-It notes and asked each to write down at least two characteristics of a crowdsourcing activity that would like make it an effective learning activity.</p>
<p>Each participant&#8217;s Post-It notes were one of three different colors, and after the participants had a chance to write down their ideas, I asked them to assemble next to three different whiteboards by color. Each color group was then instructed to post their ideas on their whiteboard and cluster them like with like. Each group also had to label each of their clusters with a word or short phrase that captured the ideas in that cluster. Once the groups had done so, I had each group share out. I had planned to have the first group share out, then ask the second group to integrate their clusters with the first group&#8217;s clusters, then do the same for the third group. I ran out of time for that, so we just did some quick sharing with the large group.</p>
<p>I have to say that I was impressed with the characteristics that the groups came up with in such a short amount of time. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this key principles question for weeks now, but the workshop participants managed to abstract most of the principles I had identified in about ten minutes. That nicely reinforced my point about the wisdom of crowds! Here are the principles the groups identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing &amp; Peer Review</strong> &#8211; The activity needs a mechanism by which students can share their (diverse) perspectives and respond to each other&#8217;s perspectives. From the instructor&#8217;s point of view, these mechanisms also make it easier to observe and monitor student learning.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing-Friendly Climate</strong> &#8211; Not only must there be a mechanism, but there must be a climate in which students feel comfortable expressing themselves and motivated to do so, even when they feel they are in the minority. How to create such an environment? Well, that was the question I had put to my Twitter friends at the start of the session! You can see their responses at the end of this blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Student-Centered Process</strong> &#8211; The activity should be constructed around helping students surface and build on their prior knowledge and experiences. The learning happens as students engage in this process, not as they &#8220;sit and get&#8221; information from their instructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>I noted that Surowiecki&#8217;s identifies a few key components of effective crowdsourcing activities: participants must be able to generate ideas <strong>independently </strong>(something we saw earlier in the jelly bean experiment), there must be some sort of <strong>decentralization </strong>so that participants can be active agents in the process, and there must be some kind of <strong>aggregation </strong>mechanism so that the group decision can be determined. I think the idea of independence is connected to the student-centered idea, since each student needs to tap into his or her own prior knowledge and experience when starting the activity. Decentralization is about putting power in the hands of students and thereby giving them some ownership in the process, which helps motivate them to share. And a good aggregation mechanism lets participants share and review each other&#8217;s work, so there&#8217;s a fair amount of alignment between Surowiecki&#8217;s principles and the ones identified by the workshop participants.</p>
<p>One point that didn&#8217;t arise during the workshop activity was the importance of asking students <strong>the right kind of questions</strong>, those that permit multiple points of view. We discussed this briefly this during our discussion of prediction markets, as I mentioned above. Even when a question is a multiple-choice question (like a prediction market question or a clicker question), there can more than one defensible answer or more than one way to arrive at a given answer. While open-ended questions by their very nature permit multiple perspectives, &#8220;close-ended&#8221; questions can, too.</p>
<p>Moreover, when you leverage the &#8220;wisdom of crowds&#8221; in your courses, you can pose questions to your students that are more challenging than ones that can be tackled by individual students. That is, these crowdsourcing techniques allow your students to take on more complex and more challenging and thus more interesting and realistic problems in your courses. That&#8217;s another plus for using these techniques.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also add that these crowdsourcing techniques are examples of <a href="http://derekbruff.com/site/blog/2011/02/14/social-pedagogies-authentic-audiences-and-student-motivation/">social pedagogies</a> in which students constitute their own &#8220;<a href="http://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/bassr/social-pedagogies/">authentic audience</a>.&#8221; These pedagogies have the potential to better motivate students to engage and learn than more traditional pedagogies in which the only audience for student work is the instructor. For example, one workshop participant asked how the discussion in a prediction market (like <a href="http://markets.nitle.org/markets/34192">this discussion</a> on the NITLE prediction markets) differs from the discussion we might ask of students in a Blackboard discussion forum. I responded by saying that the prediction market provides a game-like structure for the discussion that&#8217;s more engaging and motivating than the &#8220;busywork&#8221; context of a Blackboard discussion. And, <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2011/02/23/purpose-ed/">as Alan Levine blogged this morning</a>, motivation is a key ingredient in learning.</p>
<p>Looking back on the workshop, I probably packed in too much content in the middle. The activities at the beginning and end of the session worked very well, and I had a third activity planned that would move the participants from the more abstract thinking of key principles to more applied thinking about using these ideas in their own teaching. I probably could have skipped a couple of the crowdsourcing examples in my Prezi to have freed up more time for this application piece. I also wish I had done a better job early in the session surfacing the participants&#8217; experiences with crowdsourcing. I knew going into this workshop that it was a &#8220;version 1.0&#8243; kind of thing, however. I hope to offer a &#8220;version 2.0&#8243; of this workshop at some point in the near future!</p>
<p>Finally, here are those responses via Twitter to my question about encouraging students with minority viewpoints to contribute to discussions&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Anastasia Salter" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/MsAnastasia">@MsAnastasia</a> Anastasia Salter<br />
I find that creating environments online that students feel ownership  of creates more opportunities for diverse perspectives [+]</li>
<li><a title="Anastasia Salter" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/MsAnastasia">@MsAnastasia</a> Anastasia Salter<br />
For instance, allowing students to create safe spaces within online discourse, then encouraging others to read and respond [-]</li>

#astro101</a> very Euro-centric. Minority students share role of astronomical events in their cultures (esp Chinese, Persian)</li>
<li><a title="Ana Maria Barral" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/Bio_prof">@Bio_prof</a> Ana Maria Barral<br />
From my own experience it is all about community- feeling safe encourages expression of discordant views.</li>
<li><a title="Fraz Ismat" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/fismat">@fismat</a> Fraz Ismat<br />
First need to identify those students… I find that “random picking” sometime works.</li>
<li><a title="Fraz Ismat" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/fismat">@fismat</a> Fraz Ismat<br />
Another approach is to offer examples of alternative views &amp; ask those who agree to expand on the discussion.</li>
<li><a title="Bret Benesh" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/bretbenesh">@bretbenesh</a> Bret Benesh<br />
&#8220;What are strategies for encouraging students&#8230;to contribute to&#8230;discussions?&#8221;  Clickers?  Did I get it right?</li>

I did not like the &#8220;clicker&#8221; test&#8230;i would rather have a paper test where i can take my time and think about my answers.&#8221;</p>

<div class="postContent"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/churl/250235189/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-818" title="Writing Sample" src="http://derekbruff.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/250235189_bb8fda34f9_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>This is final (planned) post reflecting on my experiences this fall teaching a first-year writing seminar on the history and mathematics of cryptography. In this post, I&#8217;d like to reflect on what I&#8217;ve learned about teaching writing in this context. What follows is a list of observations, each followed by an idea for the next time I teach this course.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve read 15 final papers, I&#8217;m starting to get a better big picture of how argumentative papers can (and perhaps should) be constructed. Arguments support a thesis, and evidence supports an argument. I put together a Prezi to map this out:</p>
<div class="prezi-player"><!-- .prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; } --><object id="prezi_qwannvn0_ix4" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="550" height="400" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="name" value="prezi_qwannvn0_ix4" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="flashvars" value="prezi_id=qwannvn0_ix4&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;autoplay=no&amp;autohide_ctrls=0" /><param name="src" value="http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf" /><embed id="prezi_qwannvn0_ix4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="550" height="400" src="http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf" flashvars="prezi_id=qwannvn0_ix4&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;autoplay=no&amp;autohide_ctrls=0" bgcolor="#ffffff" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" name="prezi_qwannvn0_ix4"></embed></object></p>
<div class="prezi-player-links">
<p><a href="http://prezi.com/qwannvn0_ix4/arguments-and-evidence/">Arguments and Evidence</a> on <a href="http://prezi.com">Prezi</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thesis: If you break your enemy&#8217;s codes, keep that a secret as long as you can, even after hostilities have ended.</li>
<li>Argument: If the Germans hadn&#8217;t learned that their codes were broken during WW1, they wouldn&#8217;t have developed the more secure Enigma Machine.</li>
<li>Evidence: Singh notes that the Germans were &#8220;unenthusiastic&#8221; about Arthur Scherbius&#8217; proposed Enigma Machine because &#8220;they were oblivious to the damage caused by their insecure ciphers during the Great War.&#8221; (p. 138)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next time: </strong>Revise the rubric to reflect this distinction between argument and evidence. Also, show the Prezi to students and have them outline a mock paper using this model.</p>
<p>Several students included way too many details about particular  examples in their final papers, details that didn&#8217;t help them make their  arguments. Some may have been just trying to pad their page count, but  others seemed to think that sharing all these details was important.  They didn&#8217;t seem to realize that they needed to share only those  descriptive details that help the readers understand and buy their  arguments. <strong>Next time: </strong>Spend some time addressing this issue during class, perhaps by having students practice their summarization skills.</p>
<p>Some students included appropriate amounts of detail, but didn&#8217;t make  explicit the connections between their examples and anecdotes and their  theses. The reader shouldn&#8217;t have to work that hard to understand why a  particular story is included in the paper. <strong>Next time: </strong>Focus on  this, too, at some point, perhaps by having students revise a mock paper  in which these connections are not made explicit.</p>
<p>The student feedback on the course supports the idea of more learning activities focused on various aspects of the writing process. For instance, here&#8217;s a comment on the course feedback survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One thing I would suggest is adding a few short writing assignments throughout the year that can help the student see what they need to work on the most and help improve their writing skills. These can serve as ways to adjust the student to college writing without necessarily killing their grade on a major essay right off the bat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s another comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would have liked to have a greater amount of emphasis placed on writing, as it is first and foremost a writing seminar. The peer editing in class was helpful, but I would have also liked to have some discussions of grammar and general writing mechanics as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Next time: </strong>More class time spent on writing instruction. Now that I&#8217;ve taught the course once, I have more concrete ideas about activities that would be beneficial to students.</p>
<p>The students seemed to have different expectations regarding the nature of an argumentative paper. Clarifying the structure of such a paper (as described above) will help, but the paper assignment itself is a bit artificial, particularly in contrast with the earlier, expository paper assignment. For that assignment, students had an <a href="http://derekbruff.com/site/blog/2011/02/14/social-pedagogies-authentic-audiences-and-student-motivation/">authentic audience</a>: each other and the open Web since the papers were posted on the course blog. <strong>Next time: </strong>Retool the final assignment so that it&#8217;s a bit more authentic. Perhaps show students students some argumentative articles in magazines like <em>Wired</em> or <em>Scientific American </em>and have them write their papers as if they were magazine articles (but with explicit references and citations).</p>
<p>I let students use whichever citation style (MLA, APA, and so on) they wished, telling them that they needed to be internally consistent in their papers with whatever style they selected. I did this because I don&#8217;t think any one style is particularly better than another, and I didn&#8217;t want to force students to learn a new style if they already had one mastered. However, as it turned out, very few students in the course had any style mastered! Many students had problems using their selected styles correctly. For instance, I saw many Internet citations that lacked authors. While I know authors of websites are sometimes hard to identify, almost every Internet citation can be given an appropriate author if you look hard enough. <strong>Next time: </strong>Bite the bullet and have students use the same citation style. I&#8217;m thinking APA, since that&#8217;s the one I used for my book and know best. Sticking to one citation style would mean that I could become more of an expert with that style myself and, more importantly, get better at teaching it to my students.</p>
<p>Finally, I was advised by a colleague in the math department here that even if I have students write about things other than pure mathematics (which is definitely the case in this course), I should still have them <strong>write like mathematicians</strong>. How do mathematicians write? They are typically very precise in their use of ideas and arguments, and I&#8217;m glad to help my students learn to be more precise in their writing.</p>
<p>However, mathematicians are also typically very concise, providing the minimal amount of information to state their case but no more. Since mathematics is so cumulative, anytime one writes a mathematics research paper, one has to decide how much to explain about one&#8217;s work. Do you explain your ideas from first principles that you can be sure all of your readers know? Or do you assume your reader has some greater knowledge of your domain that you can leverage to avoid having to spell out in detail every step in your argument? Most mathematicians go with the latter approach, making many math papers, at least in my opinion, very difficult to read. Conciseness is prioritized over clarity, and I&#8217;m hesitant to teach my students to make that same choice.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my question for you: Should I teach my students next time to write like mathematicians, even if I think most mathematicians are poor communicators? Or am I off-base in my assessment of how mathematicians write?</p>

After heading up the &#8220;Twitter Teams&#8221; at the POD Network and Lilly Conferences this fall, I thought others might be interested in some of the lessons I learned about organizing conference backchannels. My post, &#8220;<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/encouraging-a-conference-backchannel-on-twitter/30612">Encouraging a Conference Backchannel on Twitter</a>,&#8221; outlines some of the strategies I used to help generate a healthy conference backchannel and help conference participants, particularly those not already on Twitter, to dip into that backchannel.</p>
<p>Shortly after my post went live on ProfHacker, they switched to a new commenting platform, which meant that comments are no longer allowed on my post. So feel free to comment here! What&#8217;s your experience with participating in or organizing a conference backchannel?</p>

<div class="postContent"><p><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/155918164/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-809" title="The Calm After the Show" src="http://derekbruff.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/155918164_cb8dd42438_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="141" /></a>While visiting Georgetown University last week, I participated in a discussion about social pedagogies with <a href="http://cndls.georgetown.edu/people/bassr/">Randy Bass</a>, director of the <a href="http://cndls.georgetown.edu/">Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS)</a>.  Randy and his colleague Heidi Elmendorf use the term “social pedagogies” to describe a cluster of teaching practices that “engage students with… an ‘authentic audience’ (other than the teacher) where the representation of knowledge for an audience is absolutely central to the construction of knowledge in a course.” Randy is writing a white paper on this topic drawing on the experiences and experiments of instructors in a range of disciplines. Although the white paper isn’t finished, </em><a href="http://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/bassr/social-pedagogies/"><em>the proposal</em></a><em> for the paper is available online. After reading that proposal, I prepared some opening remarks for the discussion at Georgetown, and I thought I would share an edited version of those remarks here on the blog. </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>In one of my first teaching assignments, I inherited an applied linear algebra course from a colleague. He suggested that I have students complete application projects at the end of the semester, giving them a chance to apply the mathematical techniques we had studied to &#8220;real world&#8221; problems of their choosing. This was a great suggestion, and the quality of the student papers was impressive. However, I felt it was a loss that I was the only one to ever see my students&#8217; good work. So the next semester, I had students design posters to accompany their papers. The last day of class was a poster fair in which students learned about each other&#8217;s work and voted on the best posters—most mathematically sophisticated, most interesting application, most attractive poster. This was a fun way to end the semester, and I suspected at the time that the students put more effort into the projects because they knew their peers would see their posters.</p>
<p>My suspicion was affirmed while reading Richard Light&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067401359X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=067401359X"><em>Making the Most of College: Students Speak Their Minds</em></a>.  Light&#8217;s research indicates that students take their writing more seriously when they write for their peers than when they write for their professors. His argument, as I recall it, was that a student can turn in a paper to a professor in which something isn&#8217;t explained very clearly, assuming that the professor will fill in the gaps. Students know their peers can&#8217;t fill in those gaps, so they have to work a little harder to explain themselves if they want their peers to understand them. And since they generally want to share their ideas with their peers, they put forth that effort.</p>
<p>After reading Light&#8217;s book, I asked my students in subsequent applied math courses to write their papers &#8220;as if to a fellow student,&#8221; hoping to tap into this phenomenon. I didn&#8217;t, however, actually have them share their papers with each other, just their project posters. I think this helped improve the clarity of my students&#8217; writing since they had a more concrete audience in mind, but it didn&#8217;t tap into the full effect of the idea of an authentic audience.</p>
<p>A few years later while mowing the yard, I listened via podcast to a talk by <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/">Gardner Campbell</a>, then at the University of Mary Washington. In the talk he described his use of course blogs in his English courses. He had each student start his or her own blog and post regular reflections about the course material. Students were asked to tag their course-related blog posts with a particular tag, and the &#8220;mother blog&#8221; that Gardner managed then aggregated those posts in a single course blog. This meant it was easy for students to see and comment on each other&#8217;s writings, yet each student had his or her own digital space to customize and inhabit.</p>
<p>Gardner discovered that in the students&#8217; final papers, instead of just drawing on their own writing from earlier in the course (which was common in past iterations of the course), they also drew on each other&#8217;s writings, even citing their peers&#8217; blog posts! Moreover, students from past offerings of the course sometimes left comments on the blog in response to current students posts, and on rare occasions the authors they were studying left comments, too! Gardner talked about making <em>public</em> and <em>permanent</em> the kind of student knowledge production that was once <em>private</em> and <em>temporary</em> and that doing so led to the creation of a thriving learning community.</p>
<p>Gardner&#8217;s talk was the first time it occurred to me how powerful a motivator it can be to have an authentic audience for student work. The importance of knowing one&#8217;s audience has long been a part of the teaching of writing, but even in writing courses, there&#8217;s historically not been an authentic audience, just a pretend audience. I&#8217;ve seen this in efforts to add more writing to math courses by giving students assignments in which they pretend they are consultants solving some mathematical problem posed by a client (say, a small business or a local government). Although one can&#8217;t write well without some knowledge of one&#8217;s audience, if the audience is merely a pretend one, then the motivational power of an authentic audience is absent. I think that&#8217;s why students see so much of their course work as &#8220;busywork.&#8221; There&#8217;s no authentic audience for the work. Students write papers, instructors read and grade those papers, and then the papers go in the physical or virtual recycle bin. What&#8217;s motivating about that?</p>
<p>Why is &#8220;busywork&#8221; a problem? Because when students see their learning experiences as just a series of hoops to jump through on their way to a career, most of their motivation for engaging in those learning experiences is external. They suffer through all their colleges classes because they know they&#8217;ll need a transcript (<a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/2011/02/from-a-students-view-what-does-an-a-mean/">with a healthy amount of A’s, of course</a>) to land that grad school spot or high-paying job. Unfortunately, external motivations don&#8217;t lead to deep learning, just surface learning or strategic learning. (Students who are more risk-averse tend to be surface learners, while more competitive students tend to be strategic learners, just doing enough to get that A.) Deep learning is hard work, and external motivations just aren&#8217;t strong enough for students facing that difficulty. If we want our students to engage in deep learning, we need find ways to connect that learning with their internal motivations. Conventional wisdom says we should try to convince students of the value or beauty or merit of our field, so that they develop an intrinsic interest in the subject. That&#8217;s a valuable approach, but the idea of an authentic audience opens up a different set of approaches to foster intrinsic motivation in the learning process.</p>
<p>I read Clay Shirky&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202532?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1594202532"><em>Cognitive Surplus</em></a>, over the summer, and he cited some research on motivation that has given me a better understanding of the tools I have as a teacher to motivate my students. In the book, Shirky examines the ideas that we as a society have more free time on our hands than we did in decades past and that social and collaborative technologies allow us to spend that free time together doing impressive things. Think about the open-source software movement, or the <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> crisis mapping service, or even <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">LOLcats</a>. These are all activities in which contributors receive no external rewards (such as income or jobs), yet they spend lots of time and energy in making them happen. Why do they do so?</p>
<p>Shirky points to Deci&#8217;s classic work on motivation, noting that everyone has a desire to be <em>autonomous </em>and a desire to be <em>competent</em>. The autonomy condition is satisfied in these kinds of projects because people opt in to participating. The competency condition is satisfied when people contribute something they find worthwhile—even if that&#8217;s a particularly funny LOLcat that no on else ever sees. As educators, we can leverage these personal motivations, too, by giving students choices over how they complete their learning experiences (satisfying their desire for autonomy) and by pitching our courses at that Goldilocks level—not too hard and not too easy (satisfying their desire for competency). A student might still &#8220;hate math&#8221; but feel autonomous and competent in a well-designed math course.</p>
<p>I was already familiar with Deci&#8217;s work, but Shirky pointed to some research on motivation that was new to me, <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/jopp_235.pdf">research done by Benkler and Nissenbaum on social motivations</a>. It&#8217;s this work that helps to explain why having an authentic audience can be so motivating for students. In addition to their desires for autonomy and competency, people also have desires to <em>connect </em>(to join communities) and to <em>share </em>(to share themselves with their communities). Having students write for each other on a blog, as Gardner Campbell did, taps into these social motivations. Doing so helps the students feel like they&#8217;re in a community (satisfying their desire to connect) and gives them a platform to contribute to that learning community (satisfying their desire to share). Even if the students don’t have any prior interest in the course material, they can still be motivated to participate meaningfully in a learning community because of these social motivations.</p>
<p>Consider this non-academic example: This summer, media artist and writer A. J. Patrick Liszkiewicz <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/content/cultivated-play-farmville">gave a talk about the Farmville phenomenon</a>. Farmville is a silly little Facebook game in which players grow virtual vegetables and share them with each other. Liskziewicz writes: &#8220;If <em>Farmville</em> is laborious to play and aesthetically boring, why are so many people playing it? The answer is disarmingly simple: <em>people are playing Farmville because people are playing Farmville</em>.&#8221;  There’s really nothing much to the game other than social motivations, but that&#8217;s enough to make the game very, very popular.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/bassr/files/Slide81.jpg">diagram</a> that accompanies Randy Bass’ white paper proposal includes a component that reads &#8220;connect the affective and cognitive.&#8221; The role of the affective domain in learning, that is, what students feel about learning, what motivates them to learn, is significant. I see great potential for what Randy calls social pedagogies for tapping into the affective domain by leveraging students&#8217; social motivations (their desires to connect and to share).</p>
<p>For example, last fall I posted my students&#8217; expository essays to my course blog and required students to read and comment on two of their peers&#8217; papers. This gave the students an authentic audience for their writing—each other. Moreover, some of the students Googled their paper topics and found out that their papers <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&amp;q=great+paris+cipher&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS297US297&amp;ie=UTF-8">are now on the first page of results</a> for those topics! One student said about this, “Some high school student is going to cite my paper!”  I told him that’s why I wanted him to write a good one! Even more exciting was <a href="http://derekbruff.com/site/fywscrypto/2010/11/02/expository-essay-the-chaocipher-2/">the long comment left on the blog</a> by one of the authors cited by one of my students in his paper! Given Gardner Campbell&#8217;s experiences, I had hoped something like this would happen, but I didn&#8217;t really expect it to. My students were somewhat awed that someone from their bibliographies was reading their work!</p>
<p>Another experiment in social pedagogies of mine last fall was the use of social bookmarking. I let my students contribute to their class participation grade by bookmarking and tagging resources relevant to the course material on Delicious. By asking students to use a common tag for their bookmarks (&#8220;fywscrypto&#8221;), I was able to <a href="http://www.delicious.com/tag/fywscrypto">aggregate their bookmarks</a> and share them on the <a href="http://derekbruff.com/site/fywscrypto/">course blog</a>. I made sure to spend at least ten minutes during class each week having students share their finds with the class. This kept the work from becoming &#8220;busy work&#8221; by integrating it in our class discussions, and it tapped into my students&#8217; desires to share what they were learning with their community. The bookmarking itself was easy enough technically for the students and leveraged their not inconsiderable skill in surfing the Web!</p>
<p>In both of these examples, my students were sharing their work with what I think were authentic audiences. That seems to be a key aspect of leveraging students&#8217; social motivations, their desires to connect and to share. Since those motivations are intrinsic ones, they have the potential to lead to deep learning, which is, after all, the end goal of teaching. Thanks to CNDLS and Randy Bass for the opportunity to explore these ideas together, and I&#8217;m looking forward to Randy&#8217;s white paper and future conversations.</p>
<p><em>Finally, here are a few questions about social pedagogies that occurred to me as I was preparing the above remarks:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Grade Inflation Question</em> – Here&#8217;s one that I’ve been dealing with the last few weeks: When you have a well-designed course with well-motivated students engaged in deep learning, it&#8217;s hard not to end up with a lot of A&#8217;s in the course! What’s the relationship between social pedagogies and summative assessment?</li>
<li><em>The Faculty Development Question</em> – I&#8217;m still getting a lot of oohs and aahs in consultations with faculty when I share with the idea of a think-pair-share. If that&#8217;s where many faculty are in terms of their own knowledge of teaching and learning, how on earth can I help them get to the point where they employ a variety of social pedagogies?</li>
<li><em>The Digital Native Question </em>– Randy argues in his proposal that social pedagogies need not feature educational technologies. But given how &#8220;kids these days&#8221; use technology, might there be an imperative for faculty to use social tech to enact social pedagogies?</li>
</ul>
