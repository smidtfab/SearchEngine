				<p> Apple just announced that Wi-Fi models the iPad will become available to users in China from Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers, on Friday, September 17 starting at 10:00 a.m. iPads will be sold for the retail price of CNY3988 for 16GB, CNY4788 for 32GB and CNY5588 for 64GB. Apple just opened three new stores in Shanghai, adding to an existing store in Beijing. And Apple plans to build at least two dozen stores across the country. As we reported in early August, China Unicom was rumored to start selling iPads in China in the fall. Apple says that it will roll out the iPad, which are selling like hotcakes , to &#8220;many more countries later this year.&#8221; In July, Apple announced availability in Austria, Belgium, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand and Singapore, after beginning international rollout in May.

				<p> Tokyo-based Tonchidot has come a long way since the spectacular launch of its augmented reality app Sekai Camera at TechCrunch50 back in 2008. We&#8217;ve spent quite a few articles on how the startup did since then, and the bottom line is that it did very well so far. Tonchidot is now offering up a lot more versions and features for its app (available for free on the iPhone with iOS4 support, iPad , and Android ). Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of what happened in the past few months and what more we can expect from Sekai Camera in the future. To recap, Sekai Camera makes it possible to create text messages, photos, and audio recordings (dubbed air tags) and &#8220;drop&#8221; them on the spot in the form of floating bubbles and icons. Other users in the vicinity who open the app and spin the camera around can then click on and interact with those geo-tagged virtual Post-It notes. Sekai Camera is essentially a flashy-looking, location-based, augmented reality-powered social network. Sekai Camera so far Tonchidot&#8217;s presentation at TechCrunch 50 in 2008 has since become legend, but at that time, the performance left some people skeptical about the product itself (on stage, Sekai Camera was mainly presented in the form of a video). But Tonchidot CEO Iguchi proved all skeptics wrong by presenting an early version working on an iPhone in February 2009. Sekai Camera eventually became available in the Japanese App Store in September 2009, spreading like wildfire among Japanese iPhone users, before it launched globally in December last year . In the same month, Tonchidot raised a $4 million series A and was nominated as &#8220;Best Mobile App&#8221; at the Crunchies Awards 2009 , to name just a few things that happened last year. Sekai Camera in 2010 and beyond: API, iPad and Android versions, iPhone update, Sekai Apps Tonchidot currently seems to be in overdrive mode. In March this year, Tonchidot introduced OpenAir , a Sekai Camera API that makes it possible for third parties to deliver content within Sekai Camera. Here&#8217;s a list that shows the first batch of content providers (these are Japanese companies only, but the API is available worldwide). According to Tonchidot, Sekai Camera now boasts well over one million users worldwide, and the number is poised to grow soon. In May, Sekai Camera for the iPad came out (yes, augmented reality on the camera-less iPad/screenshot below). The iPad-optimized app (obviously) can&#8217;t deliver the full experience but allows you to &#8220;visit&#8221; cities around the world and view and create air tags that other iPad and iPhone users can interact with. And just a few days ago, Tonchidot released Sekai Camera on the Android Market (screenshot below) That version offers a couple of Android-exclusive features and is available in 47 different countries. ISO 1 , an Android smartbook made by Sharp for the Japanese market , just went on sale and comes with Sekai Camera pre-installed. But Sekai Camera version 2.4.1 for iPhone is probably the most relevant for most existing users. The update, which hit the App Store just today, comes with iOS4 support and push notification. But perhaps most importantly, it features the first game that works within the Sekai Camera ecosystem. Tonchidot says that the title, a casual game called &#8220;KA-BOOM&#8221; (screenshots below), is just the first in a series of &#8220;Sekai Apps&#8221; that will be launched in the near future. The basic idea is to roll out games that combine mobile, location, augmented reality and social elements within Sekai Camera. Augmented reality-based gaming is something that has the potential to become huge and that no other company has ventured into on this scale. Tonchidot calls this concept &#8220;SoLAR&#8221; gaming and has already signed on a number of Japanese gaming firms that will deliver more content in the coming weeks. And Tonchidot is cooking up even more stuff. For example, CEO Iguchi told me that Sekai Camera will go to the web soon (users will be able to see air tags and connect Sekai Camera to other social networks through a web service) a new funding round will likely be announced in the coming weeks Tonchidot is thinking about opening offices in the US and Singapore (the company is currently searching for good candidates) We&#8217;ll keep you posted.

				<h2><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/inside-cloudcrowd-betting-on-credibility-video.htm">Inside CloudCrowd: Betting On Credibility [Video]</a></h2>
				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Jul 13th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/inside-cloudcrowd-betting-on-credibility-video.htm#respond" title="Comment on Inside CloudCrowd: Betting On Credibility [Video]">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> As one of the founders of the original Napster and CloudMark (an anti-spam service), Jordan Ritter , has always been fascinated by the idea of combining the power of the cloud and the potential of human capital. Last April, he met up with Alex Edelstein , a former CloudMark executive, to hammer out their next business plan. Over a round of beers, the idea for CloudCrowd was born. Like CrowdFlower and Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk , CloudCrowd is trying to bring labor into the cloud, by creating a vast network of workers around the globe. Today, there are roughly 25,000 workers, who have completed more than a million tasks since the site&#8217;s launch in October 2009. That represents a small fraction of CrowdFlower&#8217;s claim to 500,000 workers, but CEO Edelstein says their force is quickly expanding, with some 2,000 additions each week. Although it took 7 months to reach the one million task mark, Edelstein predicts they&#8217;ll reach 2 million jobs in 8 weeks. See video above. CloudCrowd has two main segments. The bulk of its business is client-driven work: a company submits tasks to CloudCrowd and the service will farm that out to eligible workers. Workers access CloudCrowd through a Facebook app, where they can pick available tasks and arrange payment.The tasks can be as simple as checking the quality of an image or involve the translation of entire web pages. Because pricing is determined by the level of difficulty, the payouts range from one penny to several dollars. Once a task is completed, a separate user will check the finished product for an additional fee, creating a level of quality control. The second part of their business is a new layer of consumer-facing services. CloudCrowd recently launched EditZen, a simple web site, where consumers can submit pages for editing at $4 a page. The company will soon launch TranslationZen, which will offer translation services at $19.95 a page (far cheaper than some alternatives which are priced at $60 a page). Aside from their consumer services, CloudCrowd&#8217;s cut varies widely depending on the job&#8212; ranging from a 20% cut to as high as 80%. The average worker doesn&#8217;t get paid handsomely for their task, but it can be a nice source for supplemental income&#8212; especially for workers in developing countries where salaries are generally well below America&#8217;s mean. In fact, the company now attracts more workers outside of the US, with a heavy concentration in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (many from Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore). The startup, which has yet to reach profitability, is a 15 person operation in San Francisco with modest funding. So far Edelstein is their sole investor, with $1.5 million in the project, but they are talking to major VC firms about a Series A round. The main challenge for a company like CloudCrowd is keeping pace with its ever-growing workforce. Edelstein admits that feeding the machine with sufficient volume and variety is a difficult endeavor in this early stage. The company has not spent a significant amount of capital on marketing and courting clients, instead, CloudCrowd still relies on word of mouth to attract new business. &#8220;Well it&#8217;s true that the number one complaint of our workers is give me more work, I want more availability of jobs. In both of the previous outsourcing, disruptive eras, the era of manufacturing moving to China and developing nations and the era of white collar work moving to India it took years of explaining, educating and showing corporations and all sorts of people who had work how much they could benefit&#8230;how consistent the work quality could be&#8230;.We don&#8217;t expect that overnight every single company in the Fortune 500 is going to outsource significant amounts of their work to the internet cloud but we&#8217;re sure that it&#8217;s going to happen over time.&#8221; The key to their success (and beating rivals like CrowdFlower) lies in the credibility of their workforce and amassing as much information as possible on the skills of their workers. According to Ritter, the systemÂ  is structured to create dynamic profiles on each user. Every time a user completes a task and that task is reviewed, CloudCrowd will learn how reliable that user is and which skills they excel at. If all that information is organized properly, that could be highly valuable for a client who needs to finish a targeted task in a short time frame.Â &#8221;We&#8217;re building sort of what we call the credibility graph of known reliable people on the internet,&#8221; Ritter says. &#8220;If there are particular customers who&#8230; say, &#8216;I want a thousand reliable people on the internet to do a particular job for me.&#8217; Well today you really can&#8217;t find that. Where would you find 1,000 reliable people on the internet.&#8221; CrunchBase Information CloudCrowd CrowdFlower Jordan Ritter Information provided by CrunchBase </p>

				<p> Linden Lab, the company behind virtual world Second Life, is laying off 30 percent of its staff, according to a release issued today . Labeled as a &#8220;restructuring,&#8221; the company is consolidating its software development team in North America and is &#8220;reconfiguring&#8221; its customer support department. The move reflects a new strategy for Linden Lab, says the company, which aims make its virtual world more browser based, eliminating the need to download any software. The company is also pushing for Second Life to extend to social networks. Rumors of the layoffs emerged a few days ago, and paint a more detailed picture of the reductions. The report says Linden Lab closed their UK and Singapore offices, cut the head count of the Seattle office by half, let the enterprise group go, and made staff reductions at their Mountain View and San Francisco offices. The shuttering of the enterprise group, which creates a customized version of the virtual world that sits behind a firewall, would make sense considering the new move for Second Life to be completely browser-based. Second Life&#8217;s user base has been dwindling and clearly the company is trying to take the virtual world in the direction of social networks, after seeing the popularity of gaming on these platforms. But Linden Lab isn&#8217;t completely dead. The company was reportedly valued between $658 million and 700 million a year ago. If Linden can turnaround Second Life and push the social agenda, the virtual world could rise again. Miracles can happen. CrunchBase Information Linden Lab Information provided by CrunchBase </p>

				<p> Following Shanghai , Beijing , and Seoul , the GeeksOnAPlane (GOAP) tour reached its fourth and penultimate stop last week: Singapore . The island nation isnât a very big market by itself (population: 5 million), but itâs located in the center of South East Asia, home to 600 million people. Only a small fraction of the population in that region currently has access to the web. However, itâs just a question of time until places like Indonesia (240 million people, 12.5% Internet penetration), Vietnam (89 million, 25.7%), or the Philippines (98 million, 24.5%) catch up to the rest of the wired world. Thereâs quite a lot happening in this region of the world already, as demonstrated by the 650 local entrepreneurs, investors and executives who attended echelon 2010 , a two-day web industry event organized by Singaporean startup community e27 . What follows is a summary of just a few presentations, panel discussions, and startup demos the GOAP witnessed at that event. Needless to say, there was a lot more going on during those two days in Singapore (for the purpose of this post, I am just focusing on the Asia-related stuff; here &#8216;s the complete agenda and here &#8216;s the speaker list). If you want to know more, e27 itself covered much of what happened at the event on its blog and offers a slew of video recordings on its Ustream page . Asia-related presentations and panel discussions at echelon 2010 Asia&#8217;s web industry (panel discussion) Podcast series This Week In Asia ( iTunes link ) recorded its 50th episode live on stage at echelon 2010. Guests included investor and GOAP head honcho Dave McClure , Gen Kanai ( Director of Asia Business Development for Mozilla) , Mohan Belani (Director at e27), Rama Mamuaya (founder of Indonesian tech blog DailySocial ), myself, and others. You can listen to the podcast, which touches upon various topics around Asia&#8217;s web scene, over on This Week In Asia&#8217;s site (the sound quality improves after the first two minutes), download it on iTunes , or watch the discussion on video here . Indonesia&#8217;s mobile industry (presentation) Indonesia is hot right now, not only in South East Asia. One of the most interesting (Asia-related) presentations delivered at the event came from Jakarta-based Andy Zain , founder of Mobile Monday Indonesia . Zain said that the mobile web in Indonesia is bigger than the fixed-line Internet (210 million cell phone owners), that Indonesians love browsing the web on their handsets more than anyone else (they&#8217;re consuming 661 pages monthly), and that 80% of all new handsets sold in the country are web-enabled. Here&#8217;s Zain&#8217;s presentation: Hit this link to view the presentation on video. Social gaming in Asia (panel discussion) Unfortunately, there is no video recording of the third Asia-related discussion panel (Social Gaming â How a Fast Rising Global Phenomenon is Developing in Asia) available. But e27 has summarized what the six panelists talked about in a dedicated blog post . Startup demos at echelon 2010 Thankfully, echelon 2010 not only gave big corporations and star entrepreneurs some airtime, but also made room for South East Asian startups to show their wares (dozens of them, in fact). All of the companies offer their wares in English (and quite a few were approached by investors from Asia and elsewhere on the spot, I&#8217;ve heard.) In TechCrunch 50 tradition, ten of the startups actually launched their products at the event. You can watch the entire launchpad on video here and here . Here&#8217;s a list of all the products that were first unveiled at echelon 2010: Zelrealm , a virtual items-based monetization tool for social game developers ( more info on the e27 blog) MyCube , a âdigital life management toolâ that will be built on top of existing social networks ( more info ) scraplr , a &#8220;Yahoo Answers for tasks&#8221; that makes it possible to share tasks on Facebook and Twitter ( more info ) TangoFX , a video platform (in alpha) that lets multiple users connect while consuming video content through widgets ( more info ) Pandaform , a simple form builder mainly targeted at small organizations ( more info ) foound , an LBS for the iPhone that intends to make it easier to organize &#8220;hangouts with friends&#8221; ( more info ) FlickEvents , an event management platform ( more info ) Maxus Contentian , a copywriting add-on for the Drupal CMS that&#8217;s targeted at small businesses ( more info ) MoVend , an in-app payment system for Android mainly targeting South East Asian developers ( more info ) Time Voyager , whose game engine JX2 will be marketed to makers of 3D games ( more info ) foound (tag line: âWhy check-in alone when you can hangout with friends?â) was widely regarded to be the top product of the echelon launchpad. The eponymous Singapore-based startup expects its iPhone app to hit the App Store within this month (the foound team &#8211; along with some members of the GOAP group &#8211; is pictured on top of this post). Among the around 40 exhibiting startups , I found three companies to be standing out from the crowd (although there were probably more). These were Flutterscape from Japan (a unique, cross-border social commerce platform), Creately from Australia (a collaborative online diagramming tool), and insync from the Philippines (&#8220;Dropbox for Gmail and Google users&#8221;). Many thanks from the GOAP group to the echelon 2010 organizers (especially Mohan Belani and Sneha Menon ) for their hospitality. Only a small part of the group has now moved on to Tokyo . The final stop of the GOAP tour (which formally ended after echelon) is Sapporo, where the Infinity Ventures Summit , one of Japan&#8217;s most important web industry events, will be held from Thursday. For GOAP information in real-time, follow the #goap hash tag (the official Twitter account is here ). &#8220;Official&#8221; GOAP pictures are still being uploaded over on Flickr .

				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Apr 20th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/open-network-lab-japan-gets-%e2%80%9cy-combinator%e2%80%9d-for-incubating-global-startups-2.htm#respond" title="Comment on Open Network Lab: Japan Gets âY Combinatorâ For Incubating Global Startups">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> Can you name a web service you use that originates in places like Japan, China or Singapore? Chances are you can&#8217;t, and there is a good reason: there are hardly any Asian Internet startups that made a splash outside their home territories &#8211; even though Asia by far boasts the largest chunk of the worldwide Internet user base ( 42.4% or 764 million people ). None of the seven domestic companies in Alexa&#8217;s top 10 for China , for example, are really active outside China. But movement in Asia to produce the world&#8217;s next Twitter or Facebook has been picking up steam lately, with Silicon Valley, to some extent, serving as a role model. For one, some of the most prominent initiatives in recent months are largely based on the Y Combinator model of funding multiple early-stage startups in return for ownership. And some American entrepreneurs and investors are helping with brain power and dollars, too. (Y Combinator itself isn&#8217;t involved in any of these activities in Asia.) Late last year, for example, Japan&#8217;s international model investor Joi Ito launched Neoteny Labs in Singapore, a combination of a seed-stage venture fund and an incubator initially focused on the city-state. Yesterday, three major (listed) Japanese web companies announced Open Network Lab [JP], a very similar concept with a focus on startups based out of Japan, the world&#8217;s third largest Internet nation . Open Network Lab: Japan&#8217;s first attempt to mass-produce global startups As Japan&#8217;s first attempt in this space and a potential blueprint for other Asian countries, Open Network Lab (ONL) deserves a closer look. It&#8217;s jointly run by major incubation company Digital Garage (where Ito is Director of the Board), Kakaku.com (whose eponymous price engine is Japan&#8217;s biggest) and e-commerce firm Netprice . The idea is to choose those entrepreneurs from a pool of applicants the ONL partners think are capable of producing a prototype of a web service within 3 months. The main bullet point is that the product (a prototype or alpha version is enough) must be &#8220;globally competitive&#8221; , mainly targeting markets outside Japan. Some details are different from the Y Combinator approach: Each ONL team can have a maximum of three members, and (after passing screenings) receives a maximum of about $10,000 in funding. In return for the money, mentorship, free usage of office space and other perks, the ONL founders get the right to receive a combined 5% ownership stake (they&#8217;re free to decline). In the US, Y Combinator invests $11,000 + $3000 per founder in each startup and gets back 6 or 7% in stock options. Another difference to the American model: If the startup chooses a designated mentor, it will have to give away another 2% of stock options. ONL&#8217;s mentor line-up, assembled via the Neoteny Labs connection (both labs are partnering), is pretty impressive though, including big names such as Reid Hoffman , Napster founder Shawn Fanning , or Tim O&#8217;Reilly . Successful ONL teams then get the chance to pitch their product to angels and VCs from Japan, Singapore and the US, probably after September this year (when the first batch of startups will graduate from the program). In other words, if the program pans out as promised, the Japanese entrepreneurs involved are rewarded with a once in a lifetime opportunity. Whether the Open Network Lab (or Neoteny Labs, for that matter) will actually succeed in producing globally competitive startups, however, depends on how much energy, time and money the founders themselves, the mentors and VCs are ready to invest. Unlike Y Combinator and similar incubators in America, neither ONL nor Neoteny Labs are backed by people who run the firm full-time, meaning there&#8217;s the danger of those labs turning into some kind of side project at some point in the future (Ito, for instance, holds positions in 11 different companies, according to CrunchBase ). In addition, ONL is run by partners from three different companies, covers two continents, and involves mentors and investors across three regions of the world (the situation is similar for Neoteny Labs). But from an Asian perspective, both incubators do carry the potential to make a significant impact and inject life into the startup scenes in Japan and Singapore, respectively. And one can currently observe even more efforts in Asia to build up a Chinese Twitter or Japanese Facebook, particularly on the venture capital front. These are all baby steps, but it seems Asia is finally getting ready to create an ecosystem of global startups that can keep up with what&#8217;s coming out of America.
