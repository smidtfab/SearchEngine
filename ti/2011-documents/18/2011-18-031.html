            an autumn day in 1769, Wolfgang von Kempelen, a thirty-five-year-old 
            Hungarian civil servant, was summoned to the imperial court in 
            Vienna by Maria Theresa, empress of Austria-Hungary, to witness the 
            performance of a visiting French conjuror. Kempelen was well versed 
            in physics, mechanics, and hydraulics, and was a trusted servant of 
            the empress. She had invited him on a whim because she wanted to see 
            what an expert in scientific matters would make of the conjurors 
            tricks. Yet the performance was to change the course of Kempelens 
            life. It set in motion a chain of events that led him to construct 
            an extraordinary machine: a mechanical man, dressed in an oriental 
            costume, seated behind a wooden cabinet, and capable of playing 
            Chess.<span lang="en-us"> </span></font></b></td>

        the time, elaborate mechanical toys were a popular form of entertainment 
        in the courts of Europe, though the technology they embodied was soon to 
        be put to more serious uses. So Kempelen intended his Chess-playing 
        machine to do little more than amuse the court and advance his career by 
        impressing the empress. But instead his automaton unexpectedly went on 
        to achieve widespread fame throughout Europe and America, bringing

        historical figures, including Benjamin Franklin, Catherine the Great, 
        Napoleon Bonaparte, Charles Babbage, and Edgar Allan Poe. It was the 
        subject of numerous stories and anecdotes and inspired many legends and 
        outright fabrications, the truth of many of which will never be known. 
        The Chess player was, in fact, destined to become the most famous 
        automaton in history. And along the way, Kempelen's work would 
        unwittingly help to inspire the development of the power loom, the

        modern eyes, in an era when it takes a supercomputer to defeat the world 
        Chess champion, it seems obvious that Kempelen's Chess-playing machine 
        had to have been a hoax-not a true automaton at all but a contraption 
        acting under the surreptitious control of a human operator, like a 
        puppet dancing on a string. How, after all, would it have been possible 
        to build a genuine Chess-playing machine using eighteenth-century 
        clockwork and mechanical technology? But during the eighteenth century 
        automata of extraordinary ingenuity were being constructed and exhibited 
        across Europe, including Jacques de Vaucanson's mechanical duck, 
        Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz's harpsichord player, and John Joseph Merlin's 
        dancing lady.<span lang="en-us"> </span></font></b></p>

        skeptics who insisted it was a trick, there was disagreement about how 
        the automaton worked, leading to a series of claims and counterclaims. 
        Did it rely on mechanical trickery, magnetism, or sleight of hand? Was 
        there a dwarf, or a small child, or a legless man hidden inside it? Was 
        it controlled by a remote operator in another room or concealed under 
        the floor? None of the many explanations put forward over the years 
        succeeded in fully fathoming Kempelen's secret and served only to 
        undermine each other.<span lang="en-us"> </span></font></b></p>

        </span>By choosing to make his machine a Chess player, a contraption 
        apparently capable of reason, Kempelen sparked a vigorous debate about 
        the extent to which machines could emulate or replicate human faculties. 
        The machine's debut coincided with the beginnings of the industrial 
        revolution, when machines first began to displace human workers, and the 
        relationship between people and machines was being redefined. The Chess 
        player posed a challenge to anyone who took refuge in the idea that 
        machines might be able to outperform humans physically but could not

        running in a parallel course alongside the prehistory of computing but 
        connecting in a few key places, has now assumed a new significance as 
        scientists and philosophers continue to debate the possibility of 
        machine intelligence.<span lang="en-us"> </span>Kempelen never gave his

        von Kempelen, the Turk's creator, is almost universally referred to as a 
        baron, but he wasn't one. This kind of thing happens repeatedly, so I 
        had to go back to the original reports and work through them in 
        chronological order to see what could be trusted. It was then possible 
        to see mistakes and fabrications propagate from one account to another.

        all depends how you define &quot;thinking&quot;. I go along with Alan Turing, the 
        great British mathematician, who sidestepped this philosophical question 
        with his &quot;Turing test&quot;: he defined a thinking machine as one that can 
        convince someone that it is a human in a written question-and-answer

        intelligent. The philosophers can go off and argue about whether or not 
        it's really thinking, or has a mind, or whatever, but from an 
        engineering point of view it's what the machine can do that counts. </font></b></p>
