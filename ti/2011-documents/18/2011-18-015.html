  <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;" id="internal-source-marker_0.7038105640127478">A <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/03/08/huffington-post-revolution-crowdsourcing-mob/">recent Fox News article</a>  titled &ldquo;Heads Up, HuffPro! The Mob Is Turning on Crowdsourcing&rdquo;  &nbsp;suggests that sites featuring crowdsourced content are suffering on  both ends- contributors are tiring of submitting content for free, and  readers are getting smart and recognizing the possible biases and  fallacies in user-generated content. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The article, however, ignores that  user-generated content and paid content, where contributors are  compensated for their work, often have different readerships. &nbsp;Evidence  shows that sites which pay for their content, even if it&rsquo;s sourced from a  crowd rather than tradition journalism, are not suffering the same fate  as sites relying on free user generated content. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">John Quain, author of  the Fox News article, argues that the quality of crowdsourced content  may suffer because it strays from the principal that &ldquo;people focus on  individual areas of endeavor, excel and become experts in those areas,  and ultimately get compensated for those efforts.&rdquo; Quain states that  &ldquo;these are basic principles that even technology can't change.&rdquo; </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The CloudCrowd  Credential process recognizes experts in fields such as writing,  researching and editing. Although crowdsourcing may not be able to  identify or utilize an expert versed in all areas, with widesourcing, an  expert is always available. &nbsp;Widesourcing add built-in organic  feedback, peer review, and per-task payment to crowdsourcing.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The <a href="http://www.cloudcrowd.com/">CloudCrowd</a> work  platform shows no evidence of a decline in contributors, as thousands of  new workers have joined CloudCrowd just within the past two weeks. Even  if the economy improves, there may be no end for the demand for ways to  earn some extra cash online. Thriving forums such as Work At Home Mom  (<a href="http://www.wahm.com/forum/">WAHM.com</a>) show there are large numbers of people looking for work at  home through websites such as CloudCrowd or Demand Media. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The advantages to  contributing to paid content sites include flexible hours, a choice of  projects, and the ability to work from home. The widesourcing model  allows us all to be experts at something we&rsquo;re good at- even if we&rsquo;re in  our pajamas. </span></span></p>

  <h3><a href="news/community-blog/announcing-changes-to-review-and-fix-and-how-it-affects-editors" title="Announcing:  Changes to Review and Fix and How It Affects Editors">Announcing:  Changes to Review and Fix and How It Affects Editors</a></h3>
  <p>CloudCrowd recognizes that in some instances reviewing editors introduce new errors to a document.  This is an area where the quality of CloudCrowd's editing services may suffer.</p>
<h3>What's different?</h3>
<p>CloudCrowd will now enable a second reviewer to view any changes applied to a document by a reviewing editor.</p>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>Instead of documents with changes applied through the Review and Fix functionality being auto-accepted, a new reviewer will access the submitted work.  This second reviewer will have the opportunity to review the changes made by the first reviewer.  The second reviewer will still have the option to either approve or reject the document outright; however, this second reviwer will also have an opportunity to fix any introduced or unaddressed errors.</p>
<h3>How is that different from the current process?</h3>
<p>One major change is that if the second reviewer also applies fixes to the document, there will be a third reviewer added to make a final review.  This final reviewer will only have the opportunity to approve or reject the work.</p>
<p>Because three editors will have worked on the single page of text, the reviewing process will be quite fast.</p>
<h3>Who gets the fix-it fee?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Review and Fix Fee will be split between the first and second reviewer.  This should eliminate the incentive for trying to be the final reviewer as well as disincentivize reviewers from making unnecessary changes.</p>
<h3>What happens if the reviewer rejects the document?</h3>
<p>The behavior of accept and reject changes depending on where in the review cycle you are involved.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are the first reviewer and you reject an edited document, the document is re-inserted into the CloudCrowd Editing Queue.</li>
    <li>If you are the second reviewer and you reject an edited document, the edited document submitted by the original editor is re-inserted into the Review Queue.  The first reviewer's changes are discarded completely.</li>
    <li>If you are the final reviewer of a document, the second reviewer's changes are discarded and the document reviewed and fixed by the second reviewer is re-injected into the Review Queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>I have questions not answered here; is there more information on this change?</h3>
<p>You can review the detailed changes to the <a href="http://www.cloudcrowd.com/index.php?id=264" target="_blank">Review and Fix instructions here</a>.</p>

  <p>It is a known problem that at times editors introduce errors to documents when they review and fix documents.</p>
<p>In order to improve quality and increase accountability, CloudCrowd is pleased to announce that editors will soon be able to appeal changes made during Review and Fix.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to allow editors who felt their work met CloudCrowd's <a on="" instructions="" rules="">quality expectations</a> to file appeals.</p>
<h3>How Will It Work?</h3>
<p>When we release the new appeals process you'll access it under the Appeals tab in CloudCrowd. Editors will see the tasks in which a reviewer applied fixes as well as other rejected work.<br />
<img width="533px" height="369px" alt="Example of the appeals tab on CloudCrowd" src="http://content.screencast.com/users/power9pro/folders/Jing/media/0da350f4-cb51-4675-85f8-a2bfd0299eee/2010-10-17_1846.png" /></p>
<h3>Does the Appeals Process change?</h3>
<p>The process for appeals does not change.  If you need to learn more about the appeals process, <a href="http://fe.cloudcrowd.com/popup.html?url=http%3A//www.cloudcrowd.com/help/pages/appeals_allowance.html/dont-see-appeals">view this page</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="news/community-blog/cloudcrowd-editing-review-and-fix" title="CloudCrowd Editing - Review and Fix">CloudCrowd Editing - Review and Fix</a></h3>
  <h1>New Freelance Editing Feature for CloudCrowd</h1>
<p>CloudCrowd listened to the feedback regarding work rejected for minor issues like a space missing after a comma or a small typo, and we are releasing a new version of the review process called &quot;Review and Fix.&quot;    Rather than simply rejecting work with minor flaws, reviewing editors will have an option to make minor corrections and receive a fix-it-fee for doing so.&nbsp; The Review and Fix will be released very soon so please be patient with us as we move to make what CloudCrowd sees as a major process improvement for our editors.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why do we call it a Fix-it-Fee? [and not a bonus?]</h2>
<p>We're going to call the increased pay an added <em>fee</em> because the fee will be taken from the original editor.  The original editor will essentially receive a small penalty for missing or making the mistake.  The upside is that more work will be accepted, thereby increasing the overall earnings for our editors.&nbsp; The fix-it-fee is equal to $0.25.</p>
<h3>What are the implications?</h3>
<p>The review workers will have to be even more diligent not to make changes for stylistic reasons because workers will still have the option to make appeals.  Moreover, CloudCrowd conducts routine audits of our workers and if we see that a worker is submitting a very high volume of review work as fixed, we will find people who are abusing the system. With that as the premise, there will be disagreements between editors on comma usage rules or quotation.  CloudCrowd is developing a styleguide to address this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are the conditions for making a fix?</h2>
<p>Among the first questions a reviewer is going to ask when opening a document is whether it needs fixes or not.  To help, CloudCrowd is providing a few suggested guidelines.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Missing space between words;</li>
    <li>Minor typo such as reversed letters;</li>
    <li>Slightly flawed word choice which may include incorrect preposition use, lack of the 'ly' on adverbs, inconsistent capitalization or missing a &quot;the&quot; are all great examples of minor fixes that take nearly zero time to do yet have a major impact on document quality;</li>
    <li>Punctuation errors such as incorrect semi-colon usage, quote placement or comma over-use are all easy to fix once spotted.</li>
</ul>
