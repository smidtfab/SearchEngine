			<p>Again this article in the Guardian: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/mar/28/crowdsourcing-mapping-project">How remote teams can help the rapid response to disasters</a> talks about crowds used for helping emergency response after a major disaster.  After Haiti, the users trained to OpenStreetMap used it again for Japan tragedy.</p>
<blockquote><p>A  report on humanitarian and volunteer technical groups co-operating  after the 2010 Haiti earthquake could make a big improvement to the  planning and effectiveness of response work</p>

<p>When catastrophe strikes, for the humanitarian <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Aid" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/aid">aid</a> community it often seems like we&#8217;re caught in a race – against time,  and in difficult conditions – to identify needs, deliver supplies and  save lives. Understanding the environment in which we&#8217;re trying to do  this – whether <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Haiti" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/haiti">Haiti</a>, Pakistan, Libya, or, most recently, Japan – is the key to ensuring that our response is timely, appropriate and life-saving.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>This is why I am excited about the publication on Monday of <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/global-issues/technology/disaster-report.html">Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Information Sharing in Humanitarian Emergencies</a>, a groundbreaking report we commissioned with the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership.</p>
<p>UN emergency relief co-ordinator <a title="Valerie Amos" href="http://ochaonline.un.org/OCHAHome/AboutUs/TheUSGERC/tabid/5844/language/en-US/Default.aspx">Valerie Amos</a> and the report partners are launching the report at the Dubai International Humanitarian Aid and Development (<a title="Dihad" href="http://www.dihad.org/">Dihad</a>)  conference. The theme of the conference is his year is: &#8220;New  technologies: how these impact humanitarian and development operations&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to join them!</p>

		<div class="entry">
			<p>Color is a new photo-sharing application for iPhone and Android phones.  It allows you to share the photos you have taken through it with any other Color user near you.  And you get to see also his or her pictures <img src='http://bitsofknowledge.waterloohills.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />    They defined a &#8216;proximity&#8217; criteria, that creates local temporary networks.  As soon as you leave the place, if you are no longer close to the other user, you loose access to his photos (and he to yours).</p>
<p>But if you hang around the same Color user for some time, photos will remain longer than with an occasional user.  Color is using machine learning algorithms to create this &#8216;elasticity&#8217;.  Great concept!</p>
<blockquote><p>Much of last week’s buzz surrounding <a href="http://color.com/press" target="_blank">the launch of Color</a> was justifiably <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/51478119/Color-xxx-Pitch-Deck" target="_blank">skeptical</a>.  The startup, after all, raised $41 million to enter a crowded space  without a business model or customers, and many wonder whether the world  really needs another mobile photo-sharing app. But two components of  Color’s vision — implicit networks (connections created without user  effort) and place/time tagging — extend far beyond photo-sharing, and  make the company worth watching as a potential indicator of social media  and data-mining trends.</p></blockquote>

			<p>Last friday we had a very interesting networking lunch at <a href="www.pwi.be">PWI</a> with Roz Morris, Managing Director of <a href="www.tvnewslondon.co.uk">TV News London Ltd.</a></p>
<p>She talked to us about the changes in the news media landscape, with Twitter, Facebook, Tencent and thousand of  blogs and sites where people are posting their latest news.  She presented some hard facts and funny anecdotes, but what stroke me the most was her comparison of our era with the one of the invention of the printing press.</p>
<p>Gutenberg made a big impact by giving people access to documents as the Bible for their own reading.   Since then, (almost) everybody learned to read and write.  For some years now, it is also popular to have a camera and be able to create images and videos. And then, Internet came and connected us all. And now, anyone can publish it…</p>
<p>This has a huge impact; it triggers a boom of instant information, immediately accessible to everybody.  It’s this phenomenon, as far reaching as the Gutenberg invention, that Roz calls &#8216;the News Revolution&#8217;.</p>
<p>But while people learned to publish, they still have to learn to edit before publishing…She could but urge us to be careful when expressing ourselves to any media.</p>

<p><em>As I understood from their website, it works like this:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>you post the question</em></li>
<li><em>ledface starts googling through all of its users, looking for people who are best fit to give an answer</em></li>
<li><em>chosen ones form a small team to solve the question in a collaborative manner</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>That makes it different from current Q&amp;A websites, where answers  compete with each other to become the best one. Plus, on the Q&amp;A  services we have now, you can only hope that your question will get  noticed by an expert, but ledface will take care of finding the right  people.</em></p></blockquote>

			<p>I went last week to the Quantified Self Show and Tell.  It was my first encounter with active ‘trackers’, and I was curious.  Our modern life is so busy, how could someone find more time to keep track of daily information? And is it worth it?  What about data privacy?</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/scanadude">Misha Chellam</a> acted as facilitator through the presentations, and though I’m not yet convinced to track all my moves, I have to say I liked the tools, the discussions, and the ambiance of the gathering.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/jplattel">Joost Plattel</a> told us about the difficulty of having a unified format for all the things he has been tracking in 2010.  <a href="http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/">Matthew Cornell</a> presented the <a href="http://edison.thinktrylearn.com/">Edison</a> project, with which I agree completely: a very easy framework for vulgarising the scientific method.  Do you want to do an experiment?  Declare your goal, how will you measure it, when it starts, when it finishes… then do it, Edison helps you track your progress!</p>
<p>We saw also a visual framework to show the tracked data, presented by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/ckemmler">Candide Kemmler</a>, great graphical interface! And a great plus for me, based in passive gathered data.  And last but not least, we had a presentation about data privacy. <a href="http://www.sefol.com">Ben Senior</a> presented us the actual legal situation in Germany and in the UE, and it’s sure companies should be busy adapting their sites to meet the law requirements… yet I don’t see that happening.  My kid has a completely different view about data privacy than my generation: when I warn him about the dangers to post in Facebook for ex., he says: Mom, why do you care about keeping it private?  But as discussed with Ben, misuse of personal information has historically been a problem, creating the right ‘to be left alone’. And more than ever, in this electronic data era, that right has to be preserved.</p>

			<p>Look at this Kurzweil news:<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-brain-has-three-layers-of-working-memory-allowing-for-multitasking"> The brain’s three layers of working memory allow you to multitask</a></p>
<p>They don&#8217;t mention it, I&#8217;ll have to check in the <em>Cognitive Psychology </em>journal&#8230; does this mean not only <strong>women</strong> but also<strong> men</strong> can multitask?? <img src='http://bitsofknowledge.waterloohills.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers  from Rice University and Georgia Institute of Technology have found  support for the theory that the brain has three concentric layers of  working memory where it stores readily available items, allowing for a  person to effectively multitask.</p>
<p>The researchers, Chandramallika  Basak of Rice University and Paul Verhaeghen of Georgia Tech, used  simple memory tasks involving colors and shapes on a computer screen to  determine the three distinct layers of memory. They also determined the  roles of attention focus by exploring the process of switching items in  and out of the focus of attention.</p>
<p>They found that short-term  memory is made up of three areas: a core focusing on one active item, a  surrounding area holding at least three more active items, and a wider  region containing passive items that have been tagged for later  retrieval or “put on the back burner.”</p>
<p>They also found that the  core region, called the “focus of attention,” has three roles — not two  as proposed by previous researchers. This core focus directs attention  to the correct item, which is affected by predictability of an input  pattern. Then it retrieves the item and subsequently, when needed,  updates it.</p>
<p>Their work appears in the March issue of the journal <em>Cognitive Psychology</em>.</p></blockquote>

			<p>Crowdsourcing is thought in this article as a way to handle emergency situations.   Dr Anu Vaidyanathan, in her article:  <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/eworld/article1512600.ece">Use of technology for emergency response</a> talks about her dissertation  titled <em>Proactive Crowdsourcing,</em> her name for a Location-Based Service that could be used for Emergency Response.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div id="hcenter"><img src="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/multimedia/dynamic/00495/SMS_07EW_495712f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>
<div>mars 6, 2011:</div>
<p>Minutes after the February 22, 2011, earthquake in  Christchurch, New Zealand, our power lines and water supply stopped  working. For those with a battery-operated radio, news of the unfolding  disaster was still available, minus images on television. Others like  me, with an MP3 player that could also get on radio, were limited by the  battery-life of the player itself. Most emergency lines were jammed for  the first few hours following the disaster as people came to terms with  what had happened, the news spread and calls poured in to establish the  safety of loved ones.</p>
<p>[...] Through the whole time,  what struck me as most odd was that not one mass-SMS was sent to inform  citizens about where they could access resources. The use of technology  in times of disaster can be very crucial, especially when considering  human density in places such as India where the loss of life in natural  disasters is huge. I had been through one other emergency such as this  one, when I was a graduate student during the twin tower bombings on  September 11, 2001. I was at college in Raleigh, North Carolina, which  was a good ten-hour drive from New York. However, the memories of that  night, with parents of many friends calling me from India, when they  couldn&#8217;t reach their children, will never leave me. In terms of  co-location, for the parents of my friends in India, I was the closest  to the emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive crowdsourcing</strong></p>
<p>Both  natural disasters and emergencies, especially ones that lead to massive  loss of life, bear inspection in terms of how to utilise technology to  mitigate some portions of the anxiety and uncertainty that follow such  an occurrence. In this article, I explore an idea from my dissertation  titled <em>Proactive Crowdsourcing</em> which proposes Location-Based Services in non-commercial spheres such as Emergency Response.</p>
<p>Most  proposals for managing emergencies, except in the areas of  surveillance, are reactive in nature. This curbs their effectiveness by  several orders of magnitude. In the case of emergency management, the  need of the hour is to enable more proactive solutions. Crowdsourcing is  a term used to describe de-centralising operations and trusting the  work to the co-ordinated actions of a crowd. Instead of an Emergency  Services provider waiting until the emergency has occurred, assessing  the nature of the problem and then deploying resources, if they could  instead rely on citizens co-located with the emergency, the management  of the emergency would become more agile and effective. Users co-located  with the emergency are, arguably, the best sources of information on  what might be needed to mitigate the effects.</p>
<p>Sometimes,  the requirements are not intuitive and no amount of surveillance or pre  and post-op training can predict the needs of the people affected by  the disaster. For example, in the case of Hurricane Katrina, one of the  biggest requirements that the responders fell short of was ice! Enhanced  911 (or E-911) was proposed in order to link people at the time of an  emergency to critical resources. Reverse 911 is another example of a  public safety communications system that was built to communicate with  people within certain geographies where a database of phone numbers and  associated addresses are used to identify citizens co-located with  emergencies. Both E-911 and Reverse 911 fall in the category of reactive  systems or approaches to the problem. In the case of Reverse 911, the  biggest barrier to effectiveness is that in case of a fire in San Diego,  locating all households in San Diego <em>en masse</em> may not be the  most efficient action plan. There might potentially be several people  that have travelled to San Diego from surrounding areas or from afar and  locating them is best achieved via a cell-phone, rather than fixed  geographical and list-based approaches.</p></blockquote>

			<p>The church has faith&#8230;in crowdsourcing!</p>
<p>As you can see, they did their maths:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea with the <em>online</em> vineyard is essentially the same: “many hands make light work.” The  twist with crowdsourcing, though, is that when the tasks are chunked  into minute-size efforts, more people participate. With more  participation, you can have a greater gain in productivity without  exhausting the energies of any individual.</p>
<p><img title="Traditional methods versus crowdsourcing methods" src="http://tech.lds.org/images/stories/blog/vineyarddiagram2.png" border="0" alt="Traditional methods versus crowdsourcing methods" /></p>
<p>(Left) With the  traditional model, you hire a few people to do all the work. It can take  a long time and be costly. In the crowdsourcing model (right) you make  the tasks easy and open up the work to everyone. Because of the  simplicity of the tasks, greater numbers of volunteers willingly  participate. The work is accomplished faster, and no single individual  gets exhausted.</p>
<p>With a body of 14 million Church members, if 1 percent of the  membership performs just 5 minutes of service in the Vineyard, this  equates to about 4 years of work (assuming one individual working 8 hour  days). Increase the percentage to 5 percent, and you have the  equivalent of 20 years of work – all done in a short amount of time.</p>
<h2>Challenges to Crowdsourcing</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Although our members are service-oriented, persuading members to  serve in this environment has challenges. Rather than serving side by  side with peers, you’re working online in an independent, semi-anonymous  way. The larger purpose of what you’re doing may not always be clear.  And the tasks may not feel as fulfilling as directly helping someone in  need.</p>
<p>Still, the site is new, and the way members feel towards service will  probably overcome these obstacles. You can bet that if the tasks  involved a more spiritual dimension, such as tagging scriptures,  participation would skyrocket.</p></blockquote>
<p>As they say, it&#8217;s difficult to find altruism when nobody is watching!  But I have faith in their experience moving crowds: we will have to check their site in the near future, to see how they tackled this weakness of crowdsourcing.</p>

			<p><a href="http://lifeboat.com/blog/author/kemal-akman">Kemal Akman</a> is an IT-security expert.  Look at what he is writing about the future in IT-security (or call it AI-security), when AGIs will be here:</p>
<p>(Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)  are self-improving  intelligent systems possessing the capacity to interact with  theoretical- and real-world problems with a similar flexibility as an  intelligent living being)</p>
<blockquote><p>To grasp the new security implications,  it’s important to understand  how insecurity can arise from the complexity of technological systems.   The vast potential of complex systems oft makes their effects hard to  predict for the human mind which is actually riddled with biases based  on its biological evolution.  For example,  the application of the  simplest mathematical equations can produce complex results hard to  understand and predict by common sense.  Cellular automata,  for  example,  are simple rules for generating new dots,  based on which  dots,  generated by the same rule,  are observed in the previous step.   Many of these rules can be encoded in as little as 4 letters (32 bits),   and generate astounding complexity.</p>
<div><img src="http://ka0.org/images/stories/cellular_automaton.png" alt="" width="388" height="288" />Cellular automaton,  produced by a simple recursive formula</p>
</div>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is another popular example of unexpected  complexity.  Based on a very short recursive equation,  the sequence  generates a pattern of incremental increase which can be visualized as a  complex spiral pattern,  resembling a snail house’s design and many  other patterns in nature.  A combination of Fibonacci spirals,  for  example,  can resemble the motif of the head of a sunflower.  A thorough  understanding of this ‘simple’ Fibonacci sequence is also sufficient to  model some fundamental but important dynamics of systems as complex as  the stock market and the global economy.</p>
<div><img src="http://ka0.org/images/stories/sunflower.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="250" />Sunflower head showing a Fibonacci sequence pattern</p>
</div>
<p>Traditional software is many orders of magnitude higher in complexity  than basic mathematical formulae,  and thus many orders of magnitude  less predictable.  Artificial general intelligence may be expected to  work with even more complex rules than low-level computer programs,  of a  comparable complexity as natural human language,  which would classify  it yet several orders of magnitude higher in complexity than traditional  software.  The estimated security implications are not yet researched  systematically,  but are likely as hard as one may expect now.</p>
<p>Practical security is not about achieving perfection,  but about  mitigation of risks to a minimum.  A current consensus among strong AI  researchers is that we can only improve the chances for an AI to be  friendly,  i.e.  an AI acting in a secure manner and having a positive  long-term effect on humanity rather than a negative one [5],  and that  this must be a crucial design aspect from the beginning on.  Research  into Friendly AI started out with a serious consideration of the Asimov  Laws of robotics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">[6]</a> and is based on the application of probabilistic models,  cognitive science and social philosophy to AI research.</p></blockquote>
