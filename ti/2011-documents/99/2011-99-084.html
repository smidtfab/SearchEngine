					<h2><a href="#21604" name="21604">The advertiser’s holy grail: get the context right, not just the audience</a> <span class="time"> - 1 day ago</span></h2>
					<div class="feed_entry" id="feed_entry_21604" style="display: none">
						<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-252143" title="AndyEllenthal" src="http://cdn.venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/AndyEllenthal.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="218" />Not so long ago, if you wanted to find the right audience online, the people most likely to respond to a brand message or take a desired action (whether that action was get a click or getting a consumer to think differently about a new Cadillac), advertisers really only had one option. They needed to buy a specific placement on a specific site where those types of consumers tended to congregate. Thus, specific sites or sections of sites (Yahoo or Yahoo news) were a proxy for the right audience. In other words, to reach the right audience you had to buy the right content.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. The world of online advertising has radically changed – mostly for the better.</p>
<p>Now online ad impressions can be found in marketplaces called exchanges. Advertisers can compete with each other for the most valuable impression by bidding via an auction process in real time &#8212; known as Real Time Bidding (RTB). But how do advertisers know what to bid on? Of the myriad of options available, the most common solutions are those provided by audience data companies. Audience data can be extraordinarily effective. In its simplest form, audience data tracks a consumer’s web usage and creates profiles based on browsing habits. So in these marketplaces, advertisers can determine which ad impressions have the right audience and then determine what to buy.</p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff, a fantastic evolution from just having to buy content as a proxy. How can targeting get any better than this? Essentially there is no waste, as an advertiser is only buying the audience that matters most to them – it’s almost the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach does have its shortcomings. Just because we know how and where to reach a target audience doesn’t mean that these folks are in the proper mindset to view, remember or respond to an ad. For example, if they’re engaged in content in a particular way, like emailing friends or watching videos, they won’t be receptive to certain marketing messages. Or if they are looking at pages that contain user-generated content (UGC) laced with profanity, this won’t be the environment that some advertisers will want to serve an ad into, regardless of the knowledge they may have about the user. Clearly, the ad environment is essential. If you don’t think that environment matters to an advertiser, you’re mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>Take control of the environment.</strong></p>
<p>Until now, the marketplaces I mentioned above have been unable to empower advertisers to define the environment in which they want their ads to appear. Online advertising has been disproportionately based on audience targeting, and some advertisers have dismissed environment as an unnecessary concern. But the environment problem is a major reason large brands have barely dipped their toes into RTB.</p>
<p>By incorporating data about the ad environment into the ad buying process, advertisers can not only control the delivery of their ads onto pages they were previously blind to but can proactively dictate their comfort level with quality and safety in these developing marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works.</strong></p>
<p>The technology that enables this approach is page-level semantic analysis. Websites are like networks of pages. You can&#8217;t designate a whole site to be entirely safe without knowing what is on every page. For example, any news site has content about death, accidents, catastrophes, crime, etc. Advertisers can steer clear of this specific content if they feel it isn’t appropriate for their brand, while still reaching that site’s audience on other, more appropriate pages.</p>
<p>Page-level analysis looks at individual pages rather than sites or sections to reveal data attributes that indicate the safety and quality of each page. This allows advertisers to proactively define their environment upfront. Once the environment is defined, the ad buyer can then focus on targeting ads to users or content within that environment.</p>
<p>For example, suppose an ad impression has become available on a web page that has a few family photos with captions under each one. Through real time semantic analysis of that page, the marketplace can relay to an advertiser data about the quality, safety and category of that page. In this case, the page would have a low text-to-image ratio, be considered un-moderated UGC, is safe from profanity and mature content and be labeled an entertainment page.</p>
<p>This combination of attributes might be fine for some advertisers and not for others, even if their target audience is viewing that page. With this data, the advertiser can decide which combinations of attributes define the ideal environment for their ads before making a buy or bid decision.</p>
<p>Targeting by environment is a new way to think about bidding for and buying ad placements in these real time marketplaces. It’s not just about the audience, but also where and when to reach that audience that matters. Once the guys with the money get comfortable with the audience and the environment, we will see a tectonic shift in how dollars are spent online.</p>

					<h2><a href="#21599" name="21599">Social Browser RockMelt Makes Its First Big Upgrade</a> <span class="time"> - about 2 days ago</span></h2>
					<div class="feed_entry" id="feed_entry_21599" style="display: none">
						<p>RockMelt, the Web browser that launched last fall with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, is releasing some improvements today that co-founder and chief executive Eric Vishria told me will tackle the two biggest requests from users.</p> <p>Vishria and his co-founder Tim Howes have said that their goal with RockMelt is to re-think the browser in a way that makes sense for a more social, interactive Web experience. Instead of having to constantly return to their favorite websites and social networks, RockMelt users can view their friends’ Facebook and Twitter updates, get notified about new content on their favorite websites, and start Facebook Chats with their friends — all through the browser itself.</p> <p>The new version of the browser, RockMelt Beta 2, should improve this experience in a couple of key ways. It now includes a Facebook Chat Bar at the bottom of the browser, so that users can have tabs for multiple chats at once. At the same time, Vishria said some users are actually turning the chat feature off because they’re worried about getting bombarded by Facebook friends, so RockMelt now notifies you about a chat without opening a full chat window, making it easier to ignore messages if you’re busy or if they comes from someone you don’t want to talk to.</p> <p>The other big improvement is to RockMelt’s Twitter support, adding things like the ability to view all your “@ replies” on Twitter and taking advantage of Twitter search. This makes it more likely that RockMelt users can address all their Twitter needs within the browser, and less likely that they’ll have to visit the Twitter site itself.</p> <p>The third major addition involves what Vishria said is a rethinking of bookmarks. Many people just don’t use bookmarks anymore, he said, but at the same time he saw something promising in apps like Instagram, which let you bookmark content to read later. So in addition to traditional bookmarks, RockMelt now has a “view later” option, where you can add content that you want to read later, but that you don’t want to permanently add to your bookmarks.</p> <p>When RockMelt launched, the company got a lot of attention because of its ambitious vision and its backing from a venture firm whose partners included Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen. But there was also plenty of skepticism, because it seemed other startups had attempted and failed to achieve similar goals. This week, Mountain View, Calif.-based RockMelt didn’t share its total user numbers, but it didn’t reveal a few interesting promising facts about its users. On average, RockMelt users are spend more than six hours per day in the browser and share content every two to three days. The average user has three chats per day on RockMelt. And 41 percent of RockMelt’s United States users are in high school or college.</p> <p>“We wanted to build the next generation browser, so it’s gratifying to see that it’s actually being embraced by the next generation,” Vishria said.</p> <p id="tags" class="taxonomy">Tags: social web browsers, web browsers</p> <p class="taxonomy">Companies: RockMelt</p> <p class="taxonomy">People: Eric Vishria</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

						<p><strong>GNC Holdings Inc.</strong> saw its shares rise in its New York Stock Exchange debut Friday, <em>Reuters</em> reported. The company, a retailer of wellness and nutrition products, saw its shares reach $16.55 in early trading, after pricing at $16. <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, GNC&#8217;s previous owner, had tried to take GNC public twice before selling the store chain to <strong>Ares Management LLC</strong> and the<strong> Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan Board</strong> in 2007, <em>Reuters</em> wrote. Ares planned to sell 2.4 million shares in the IPO. OTPP planned to sell 3 million shares.</p>
<p>(<em>Reuters</em>) - Shares of GNC Holdings Inc GNC.N, a U.S. retailer of wellness and nutrition products, rose in their New York Stock Exchange debut on Friday after its IPO priced at midpoint of the proposed range.</p>
<p>GNC shares added 3.4 percent, to $16.55, in early NYSE trade after pricing at $16 in the company&#8217;s third attempt at a public offering.</p>
<p>GNC, seller of vitamins, herbal supplements and sports nutrition products, first said it was planning an IPO last September after an acquisition by China&#8217;s Bright Food Group fell through early in the year.</p>
<p>Apollo Global Management (APO.N), GNC&#8217;s previous owner, had tried to take GNC public twice before selling the store chain to Ares Management LLC and the Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan Board in 2007.</p>
<p>Ares planned to sell 2.4 million shares in the IPO, while OTPP planned to sell 3 million shares. The IPO was expected to sell 22.5 million shares in total for $15 to $17 each.</p>
<p>If underwriters exercise their overallotment option, Ares and OTPP&#8217;s combined voting power in GNC is expected to decrease by about a quarter to roughly 66 percent.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan led underwriters on the IPO. (Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Derek Caney)</p>
