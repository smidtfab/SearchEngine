		<p>Last week we held our annual Future Summit &#8211; Sydney and San Francisco linked via TelePresence!</p>
<p><a href="http://futureofcrowdsourcingsummit.com/">Future of Crowdsourcing Summit</a> &#8211; the topic itself was sure to grab a lot of attention. Then there was the AMAZING line up of speakers who gave us all some great insights into the field of crowdsourcing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theinsightexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/Panel_Camera.jpg"><img src="http://www.theinsightexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/Panel_Camera.jpg" alt="Future of Crowdsourcing Summit" title="Panel_Camera" width="600" height="376" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1797" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/ANZ/index.html">Cisco Australia</a> provided us with a great venue in Sydney &#8211; together with the TelePresence functionality to San Francisco.<br />
<a href="http://www.cbsinteractive.com"><br />
CBS Interactive</a> kindly provided the venue in the valley.</p>
<p>Here is some of the content that has been shared online.</p>
<p>Ross Dawson kicked off the compact event with an introduction to the summit and a copy of Advanced Human Technologies&#8217; <a href="http://crowdsourcingresults.com/wp-content/themes/crowdsourcing-results/images/crowdsourcing-framework_v2_480.jpg">Crowdsourcing Framework</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://victorsandspoils.com/">Victors &#038; Spoils</a> CEO, John Winsor enlightened us with a keynote on how his company became the first advertising agency to successfully embrace crowdsourcing.  Here&#8217;s an interesting write up write up from Beverly Head at IT Wire.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/networking/42881-harley-davidson-taps-internet-vroom-vroom">Harley Davidson taps internet vroom-vroom</a></strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;It was also important for the sustainability of the model for people tapping into clouds to make sure that there was value not just for clients, but crowd participants. “How do we build the community, not just use the crowd?” he mused.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies tapping into these vast pools of talent also had to work out how to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their clients. Mr Winsor said that in some instances this had led to members of the Victor &#038; Spoils crowd being asked to sign non disclosure agreements prior to being provided with the client brief.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Nate Cochrane at itnews shares his insights of the summit with us, as well as snippets from each panel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/237470,cloud-meet-crowd.aspx">Cloud, meet crowd</a><br />
<em><br />
&#8220;&#8221;The individual knowledge worker or expert should be scared and I&#8217;d say they should be scared into action,&#8221; said Gary Swart, chief executive officer of online temp agency oDesk.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing was the act of commissioning groups of people over the internet to perform tasks, usually much cheaper than employees.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Live coverage on twitter was streaming all day &#8211; very exciting at times. I have picked out a few of my favourites:</p>
<p><strong>@stilgherrian:</strong> Pleased that John Windsor of Victors &#038; Spoils actually recognises that the crowd participants have to get &#8220;value&#8221; too. <strong>#foc10 </strong></p>
<p><strong>@lisaharvey: </strong>John Windsor: how do you create the community and not just use the crowd <strong>#foc10 </strong></p>
<p><strong>@pinglo:</strong> Looking at SanFran looking at us. Cross-continental panel at <strong>#foc10 </strong><a href="http://twitpic.com/33e3e1">http://twitpic.com/33e3e1</a></p>
<p><strong>@roneo:</strong> Re crowdsourcing:Nicholas Gruen says the world is being taken over by participators.The participation partition is the real challenge.<strong>#foc10 </strong><br />
<strong><br />
@roneo:</strong> Kevin Bloch Cisco Aust CTO says the iPad is already out if date b/c it can&#8217;t capture events &#038; conversations on video. <strong>#foc10 </strong></p>
<p><strong>@jtwinsor:</strong> @rossdawson great event tonight. Learning a lot.<strong>#foc10 </strong></p>
<p><strong>@AbiGoldflake: #foc10 </strong>crowdsourcing work as a way of interviewing new job applicants &#8211; Dr Gruen </p>
<p><strong>@amylyden:</strong> Crowdsourcing is the ability to hire 1/10 of a person &#8211; gr8 4 startups. Lukas Biewald CEO CrowdFlower <strong>#foc10</strong></p>
<p><strong>@bhc3: #foc10</strong> Alex Edelstein of CloudCrowd wants to leverage crowdsourcing for the workflow process for different activities.</p>
<p><strong>@silverton: #FOC10 </strong>&#8220;There&#8217;s a real opportunity to make a fairer world.&#8221; Lukas Biewald @crowdflower </p>
<p><strong>@bhc3: #foc10</strong> AMP&#8217;s @maverickwoman notes employees have a cognitive surplus, and are attracted to participating. <strong>#e20</strong></p>
<p><strong>@kobygeddes #foc10</strong> good crowdsource example Mark Scott, JJJ Unearthed<br />
<strong><br />
@silverton: #FOC10</strong> In journalism, &#8220;What happens when a user is better than your reporter?&#8221; &#8211; Larry Dignan, ZDNet </p>
<p><strong>@silverton: #FOC10</strong> &#8220;The corporate structure hasn&#8217;t changed in 120 years; today, fundamental change is underway.&#8221; Mat Fogerty</p>
<p><strong>@metarand</strong>: Matt Barrie telling it like it is &#8211; crowdsourcing fundamentally changing employment market <strong>#foc10</strong></p>
<p><strong>@amylyden</strong>: Cool tool: storify helps you create stories from social media. Love it @burtherman <a href="http://bit.ly/cGysgN">http://bit.ly/cGysgN</a> (expand) <strong>#foc10 </strong></p>
<p><strong>@amylyden</strong>: Alek Lynch DesignCrowd is talking about crowdsourcing your unborn child&#8217;s name (love this). <strong>#foc10</strong> not sure about the in china part tho. </p>
<p><strong>@bhc3: #foc10</strong> Odesk taps into underemployed people distributed globally, affords them opportunities outside their local market. </p>
<p>The event attracted a familiar crowd and inspired some great conversation.</p>
<p>Cant wait for the next one!</p>

		<p>The iPad strategy Workshop turned out to be a great success! With over 100 people registering to attend the room was chock full to the brim!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theinsightexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0203_cropped.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1605" title="iPad Strategy Workshop" src="http://www.theinsightexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0203_cropped.jpg" alt="iPad Strategy Workshop" width="600" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>We were all excited to receive a copy of the <a href="http://rossdawsonblog.com/weblog/archives/2010/08/visualization_o.html">Visualization of top iPad News apps in Australia</a> which was produced by <a href="http://rossdawson.com/">Ross Dawson</a>, Chairman of <a href="http://www.futureexploration.net/">Future Exploration Network</a>. Here he explains the Visualization in more detail:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The chart shows in the left hand column free apps, and on the right hand side paid apps, each ranked from #1 to #30 in order of popularity on iTunes. The following bar shows the price (for paid), the user rating on iTunes, and the size of the download in MB. The horizontal axis for paid apps indicates price.</em></p>
<p>Seb Chan of Powerhouse Museum, has written a great write up<a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/dmsblog/index.php/2010/08/28/the-first-ipad-exhibition-catalogues-and-a-strategy-framework/">&#8220;The first iPad exhibition catalogues and a strategy framework&#8221;</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Obviously in the newspaper space the iPad is both a source of hope and terror. When the Flipboard App was shown there was a palpable sense of ‘but they aren’t seeing the advertisements’ around the room. On the other hand there was some fascinating data from the New Zealand Herald and The Australian around the take-up rates, growing in-app subscribers, and in-app advertising engagement that all point to new opportunities for news media.</em></p>
<p>It wont be long until our next event so stay tuned and watch out for our next email!!</p>

		<p><strong>ROSS DAWSON:</strong>	I think an interesting question to start off is: Australia is a global crowdsourcing hub, as I’ve said and you’ve heard today. Any particular thoughts from any of you as to why this might be the case?</p>
<p><strong>MATT BARRIE:</strong>	I think it might be a coincidence but also I’m aware that we’re a long way away from everything else, and I think we’re used to going overseas and thinking overseas. There are some pretty big sites in America and it’s increasingly changing.</p>
<p><strong>ROSS DAWSON:</strong>	There is a distinction. We have a number of great outsourcing platforms in Australia but your clientele is largely international.    Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MATT BARRIE:</strong>	Our Australian clients are less than 3% of the total.</p>
<p><strong>ROSS DAWSON:</strong>	There is not a lot of usage by Australian businesses at this point.  I don’t have any stats but it seems that it is actually not that high  in Australian usage, whereas we do have several platforms here.</p>

		<p>On Monday night we launched our new series of events for the small to medium business sector with a great topic: <a href="http://www.theinsightexchange.com/events/sme-technology-forum-series/">&#8220;Getting Results from Crowdsourcing&#8221;</a>. Thanks to our Venue sponsors <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_AU/au/index.htm">Deloitte</a> for providing a fantastic space.</p>

<strong>Tony Hollingsworth and Luke Harvey-Palmer moderating their roundtables</strong></p>
<p>Several years ago crowdsourcing wasn&#8217;t even a word. Today it is  a tool that millions of businesses are taking part in.</p>
<p>The four panelists were great. Each shared a 5 minute presentation on crowdsourcing, presentations that had slides can be found on our <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TheInsightExchange">slideshare</a> page. We captured it all on video &#8211; which we hope to have up in the next week or so. </p>
<p>I want to share with you some web coverage from the event and part of the Twitter stream. </p>
<p>Tony Hollingsworth (host of one of the four expert roundtables: &#8220;building online communities&#8221;), <a href="http://tonyhollingsworth.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/getting-results-from-crowdsourcing-sme-technology-forum-series/">wrote an excellent blog post</a> on the event:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;Now back to crowdsourcing. The Internet has allowed tools to be built which let us connect, collaborate, converse and build community. Why build community online? You can scale up your relationships for business success. Relationships add value to your network, to your brand, and ultimately your bottom line. I’d rather have someone recommend me to you, than me having to do all the recommending. How do you feel about “shameless self-promoters”? You know you’re good, so my advice is to demonstrate why to others, then they will promote you.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Paul Wallbank, columnist for <a href="http://www.smartcompany.com.au/index.php">SmartCompany.com.au</a>, has provided a <a href="http://www.smartcompany.com.au/business-tech-talk/20100601-the-crowd-sourcing-revolution.html">great write up on crowdsourcing</a>:</p>
<p><em>As low cost solutions for relatively simple tasks involving no intellectual property, internet outsourcing and crowd sourcing are a good solution for big and small business. </em></p>
<p>You could hear the tapping of keypads as <strong>#TIECrowd </strong>was being broadcasted.  Here are a selected few from the night:</p>
<p><strong>@paulwallbank:</strong>@IdeasCulture explaining how to create a virtual ideas market <strong>#tiecrowd </strong>http://twitpic.com/1sp7u8 </p>
<p><strong>@hollingsworth: </strong>Small business should focus on simple, discrete tasks when crowdsourcing, says Alec Lynch from DesignCrowd <strong>#TIECrowd </strong></p>
<p><strong>@CatrionaPollard:</strong>Just heard the 5 top tips on how to run a successful crowd sourcing. <strong>#TIEcrowd </strong></p>
<p><strong>@PC World Australia</strong>  Phil Sim talks about developing business apps using crowdsourcing &#8211; or cloud labour &#8211; in a SMB <strong>#tiecrowd. </strong>&#8220;Gotta learn how to do it!&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>@miscx:</strong> <strong>#tiecrowd</strong> getting specifications spot on, setting clear expectations, investing time is required for good crowdsourcing results </p>
<p><strong>@g_flashman: </strong><strong>#tiecrowd </strong>&#8220;anything non-core can be outsourced.&#8221; question: if you had unlimited labour at lo cost what would you do with your business ? </p>
<p><strong>@n2nComm: </strong><strong>#tiecrowd </strong>opportunity: how to outsource the project management of crowd sourcing </p>
<p><strong>@g_flashman: </strong><strong>#tiecrowd</strong> &#8220;the better you specify what you want, the better outcome you will get.&#8221;. &#8211; matt Barrie , CEO freelancer.com </p>
<p>Also at the event &#8211; Ross Dawson released his BETA version of the Crowdsourcing Landscape which can be found on the newly launched site<a href="http://www.crowdsourcingresults.com"> www.crowdsourcingresults.com</a></p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on upcoming events!</p>
