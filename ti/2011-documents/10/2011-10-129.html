				<p> Nlyte Software (formerly Global DataCenter Management) closed a $12 million series C investment led by NGEN Partners with Balderton Capital, Ruffer LLP and Montalcino Holdings participating in the round. The Menlo Park green IT company provides data center infrastructure management (DCIM) software and services. </p>
<p>Nlyte Software&#8217;s chief executive Jon Temple says, &#8220;We help data center managers with capacity planning, so there&#8217;s an efficient use of power, cooling and space, and optimal placement of data assets [within their facilities].&#8221; </p>
<p>Datacenter owners and managers can use nlyte to understand and predict: what&#8217;s in their ever-changing inventory of equipment; where every server or rack is located within their facilities; how systems that are run by this equipment may be effected as it is moved around; and how the data centers can be tweaked to operate more efficiently.</p>
<p>According to a new study from KTH’s Centre for Sustainable Communications, the global IT and telecom sector in 2007, defined in a way that excludes the impact of the increasingly digital media and entertainment sector, accounted for at least 1.3 percent of the world’s total greenhouse emissions. </p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from cloud computing alone are expected to triple by 2020, according to forecasts by Greenpeace. </p>
<p>DCIM solutions— like those offered by nlyte, Emerson Network Power, and Modius— reduce data center energy consumption by 20% on an annualized basis according to Gartner research. Nlyte&#8217;s website claims its software can extend the lifetime of an existing data center facility by 75% or about 5 years. </p>
<p>Nlyte sells to businesses that have 100 or more racks in their data centers. &#8220;We’ve only seen one data center in one hundred today taking advantage of this type of technology which represents a huge opportunity for us,&#8221; Temple said. </p>
<p>IDC researchers have counted more than 106,000 data centers of this size in operation today. Cloud computing, outsourcing and other trends are contributing to increased demand on existing data centers, and the build of new data centers, Temple says.</p>
<p>Nlyte plans to use its series C growth capital to market its services in North America, primarily, with some expansion plans in continental and Eastern Europe, and Asia-Pacific Rim. With the investment, NGEN&#8217;s managing director Rosemary Ripley, will join nlyte Software’s board of directors. </p>

								<p>CrowdFlower is one of many Web 2.0 businesses that taps the power of the crowd to get work done. Today, the company is formally releasing its Business Listing Verification service, which gives companies accurate business contact data that has been recently verified.</p>
<p>This kind of service is important in the current economy, where many businesses are changing locations or contact information. I could benefit from it myself; I once sent 10 people to a restaurant that didn&#8217;t exist at the location where a location-based service told me it was. The consequences of having the wrong information can also be more serious, such as having inaccurate information for a hospital location.</p>
<p>The service uses web-based labor pools to verify attributes such as business name, address, phone number, and web address. The paid workforce operates much like Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk, which pays people for fulfilling small jobs on the web. By getting a human to verify information, the company ensures its data is accurate, said Lukas Biewald, chief executive of CrowdFlower (pictured right), in an interview. Basically, it farms out tasks on the web and pays people to verify the information. It calls this &#8220;labor on demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We built CrowdFlower to sell crowdsourcing to the enterprise,&#8221; Biewald said.</p>
<p>CrowdFlower also provides redundant verification and has other ways to make sure that its workers aren&#8217;t just verifying every request without actually checking it. It does so by asking laborers to verify contacts that it already knows are accurate or inaccurate. The laborers who come up with the best results are allowed to keep working, while those who provide inaccurate help are bypassed.</p>
<p>The problem is that a lot of lists being sold by various directory services are old and inaccurate. CrowdFlower has set up a system by which humans can apply their own judgment and figure out quickly if a listing is accurate or not. With CrowdFlower, Biewald says that web-based workers can generally verify data with a phone call or by some other means. That way, the laborers can find out if a restaurant has shut down or a business has moved to another address. In the U.S., some 552,600 new firms opened for business in 2009, and some 660,900 closed. That means the overall annual turnover among businesses was 10 percent.</p>
<p>The cost of doing the verification runs anywhere from 10 cents to $2 per listing. CrowdFlower charges a small markup and says it consistently delivers an average accuracy of 95 percent. CrowdFlower can tap 11 different labor pools with more than 500,000 people from 150 countries. To encourage more workers to participate, Biewald said his company is considering rewards or making the experience of doing the work more game-like.</p>
<p>Companies that could benefit from this service include providers of business lists, online map makers, Global Positioning System (GPS) product makers, and owners of sales databases. The company began testing the service a while ago and verified more than 8 million listings in October.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based CrowdFlower was founded in 2007 with the aim of applying statistically backed, quality-controlled crowdsourcing for businesses. The founders include Biewald and Chris Van Pelt, who both worked at search engine Powerset. CrowdFlower has 49 employees. Rivals include outsourcing companies. CrowdFlower raised $5 million in January from Trinity Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Freestyle Capital, K9 Ventures, and Quest Venture Partners.</p>

There is a subcategory of folk art paintings since I was a child.  I don't particularly care for his art. When she died, she left me  the painting and it hangs in a place of honor over my fireplace  mantle. It's of a swamp house on a bayou and has a Louisiana feel.....</p>

        . It's a beautiful painting but it's just too depressing to hang  anywhere.There is a subcategory of folk art paintings that depict  the world of black Americans. It's called Alligator Fisher and I'm  thinking about getting because it reminds me of my cajun heritage,  most of my family is from Louisiana.One of my favorite paintings  was done in 1962 by Bill Dodge.The painting that has touched me  the most features a sad little girl and is called A Letter From  My Mother. It's too bad my parents didn't let her play football  with us. One of my favorites that she had was done by John Roeder.My  sister also shares my love for folk art.Another painting that I  admire is called Howard in 1944. It's pretty funny to me that when  we were growing up, she'd cry because she wasn't allowed to play  football with the boys and I used to tease her relentlessly and  pull her pigtails whenever I got the chance. I spent a lot of time  playing in my tree house, that the trees in the picture appealed  to me so much. I saw a painting he did of a fishing scene but I  chose not to buy it. Still, they are a joy to behold. She looked  so relaxed, that I could imagine what it felt like to lie there  myself. Now we're very close. I'll find someone to give it to. I  personally don't have any of these in my collection, since I like  to collect pieces that I can relate to.There is a water scene that  I really like painted in 1940. I have a friend who collects these  and I found one of a woman reclining in a hammock. It is done in  vibrant colors and also depicts the buildings in the market like              <p><a href=>ata outsourcing</a> <a href=>dta outsourcing</a> <a href=>daa outsourcing</a> <a href=>dat outsourcing</a> <a href=>data utsourcing</a> <a href=>data otsourcing</a> <a href=>data ousourcing</a> <a href=>data outourcing</a> <a href=>data outsurcing</a> <a href=>data outsorcing</a> <a href=>data outsoucing</a> <a href=>data outsouring</a> <a href=>data outsourcng</a> <a href=>data outsourcig</a> <a href=>data outsourcin</a> <a href=>sata outsourcing</a> <a href=>fata outsourcing</a> <a href=>dsta outsourcing</a> <a href=>dara outsourcing</a> <a href=>daya outsourcing</a> <a href=>dats outsourcing</a> <a href=>data iutsourcing</a> <a href=>data putsourcing</a> <a href=>data oytsourcing</a> <a href=>data oitsourcing</a> <a href=>data oursourcing</a> <a href=>data ouysourcing</a> <a href=>data outaourcing</a> <a href=>data outdourcing</a> <a href=>data outsiurcing</a> <a href=>data outspurcing</a> <a href=>data outsoyrcing</a> <a href=>data outsoircing</a> <a href=>data outsouecing</a> <a href=>data outsoutcing</a> <a href=>data outsourxing</a> <a href=>data outsourving</a> <a href=>data outsourcung</a> <a href=>data outsourcong</a> <a href=>data outsourcibg</a> <a href=>data outsourcimg</a> <a href=>data outsourcinf</a> <a href=>data outsourcinh</a> <a rel="nofollow" title="data outsourcing" href="http://outsourcing.bgfeed.com/img/4839941981_1b7be1e8cd.jpg"><img src="http://outsourcing.bgfeed.com/img/thumb_4839941981_1b7be1e8cd.jpg"></a>
