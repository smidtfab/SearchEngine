<h2 class="nb">$50 CrowdFlower Credit</h2>

Thanks to continuing sponsorship from <a href="http://crowdflower.com">CrowdFlower</a>, we are once again able to offer free credits to anyone wanting 
to try crowdsourcing via their platform.  Anyone who commits to submitting a workshop paper can request the free $50 credit (provided they did not 
already receive CrowdFlower credit from the CSE 2010 workshop at SIGIR). Just create
a CrowdFlower account, then email joseph at crowdflower dot com and CC <a href="http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml">Matt Lease</a> to request the 
credit per participation in the CSDM 2011 workshop.

</div>

<p>We invite submissions of papers describing novel, unpublished research addressing one or more of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="spacer">Theoretical, experimental, and/or methodological developments advancing state-of-the-art knowledge of crowdsourcing for search or data mining</li>
<li class="spacer">Applications of search or data mining related crowdsourcing.</li>
<li class="spacer">Tutorials on how different forms of crowdsourcing can be best suited to or best executed in evaluating different search or data mining tasks</li>
<li class="spacer">New software packages which simplify or otherwise improve general support for crowdsourcing, or particular support for related crowdsourced tasks (e.g. <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/turkit/">TurkIt</a>, <a href="http://qmturk.appspot.com">qmturk</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/turksurveyor">Turk Surveyor</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/get-another-label">Get Another Label</a>, etc.)</li>
<li class="spacer">Reflective or forward-looking vision on use of crowdsourcing in this area </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="nb">Most Innovative Awards - Sponsored by Microsoft</h2>
Similar to the <a href="http://ir.ischool.utexas.edu/cse2010/program.htm">Crowdsourcing for Search Evaluation Workshop (CSE 2010)</a>  at SIGIR, the most novel and innovative papers will be recognized with "Most Innovative Awards" as judged by the workshop organizers. Selection will be based on the creativity, originality, and potential impact of the described proposal, and we expect the winners to describe risky, ground-breaking, and unexpected ideas. The provision of awards is thanks to generous support from <a href="http://www.bing.com">Microsoft Bing</a>, and the number and financial amount of the awards will depend on the quality of the submissions and overall funding. All valid submissions to the workshop will be considered for the awards.

The workshop especially calls for innovative ideas for better using crowdsourcing platforms such as 
<a href="http://www.mturk.com">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>, 
<a href="http://crowdflower.com/">Crowdflower</a>, 
<a href="http://www.domystuff.com/">DoMyStuff</a>
<a href="https://www.livework.com/">Livework</a>, etc.

<p>While mature research is certainly welcome, we particularly invite submissions of new and innovative ideas that may only have preliminary evaluation. Similar to WSDM 2009’s Late Breaking-Results track, we especially welcome more risky and/or ground-breaking, innovative research ideas, methods, results, and position statements.</p>

<p>Submitted papers will be evaluated on the basis of novelty, technical depth, elegance, practical application, impact, and presentation. Particular emphasis will be placed on innovation, especially with respect to “Most Innovative Awards” (described below). Selection of these awards by the organizers will focus on the creativity, originality, and potential impact of the work with less emphasis on demonstrating a well-proven, empirically established technique. We encourage authors to submit risky, ground-breaking, and unexpected ideas.</p>

<h2>Special issue of <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1386-4564">Information Retrieval</a> journal on Crowdsourcing</h2>

<p> Workshop organizers will edit a special issue of <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1386-4564">Information Retrieval</a>, a Springer journal, on <i>Crowdsourcing for Information Retrieval</i>.  See the <a href="http://ir.ischool.utexas.edu/irj-crowd-cfp.pdf">call for papers</a>.
The timing of the special issue will allow workshop participants an opportunity to develop extended versions of their workshop papers for submission to the special issue (with separate refereeing from the workshop).
