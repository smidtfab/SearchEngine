<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">During the 18th century, automatons were the rage in Europe and they were 
mainly built for the enjoyment of the wealthy. They were machines that seemed to 
mimic life. One such automaton was a mechanical flute player displayed by 
Jasques de Vancanson in 1737. It could play a tune while altering its lips and 
fingers. But his most famous automaton was a mechanical duck that would take 
grain from a spectator and eat it, drink, quack, splash in the water and digest 
it's food like a real duck and excrete it. It was the first time that a tube 
made of rubber from India was use, and this lead to the invention of flexible 
rubber tubing.</font> </font></span></p></div>

<p align="justify"><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Vancanson's main interest in 
inventing these types of machines was to understand the biological systems of 
man so to cure their diseases. In 1741, he was hired to modernize the French 
weaving industry. He drew up his plans that were to be tested in the city of 
Lyons by the silk workers. However, he had to flee for his life due to the riots 
that were created by the workers. They were afraid that they would become human 
parts of a huge automaton. So he quickly returned to Paris and became the 
official examiner of new mechanical inventions for the <i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Acad�mie des Sciences</span></i></font></font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"><font face="Arial" size="2">. Members of the Acad�mie des 
Sciences did scrutinize the Turk, but they were unable to learn its 
secret.<br><br>There are, of course, many myths written about the Turk. One such 
myth is a story in the Encyclopedia Britannica (1911), explaining its secrets by 
Jean Robert-Houdin. His theory was that a Polish soldier by the name of 
Worousky, who lost both his legs in Russia during a rebellion, was smuggled out 
of Russia by Klempelen [the creator of The Turk] to tour the world inside the 
automaton.<br></font></p></SPAN></div></div><IMG style="Z-INDEX: 100; LEFT: 138px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 581px" height=173 alt="" src="JacquesVaucanson.gif" width=131 border=1><IMG style="Z-INDEX: 100; LEFT: 427px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 521px" height=295 alt="" src="MecDuck.gif" width=332 border=0>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Another myth was that Klempelen was a 
Baron, but this was not true.<br><br>The idea of a chess-playing machine became 
a reality in 1769, when Wolfgang von Klempelen created an automaton called 'The 
Turk' for the Empress Maria Theresa. He boasted at court that he could build a 
chess-playing automaton better than the famous builder of automatons (Vancanson) 
in 6 months.<br><br>Klempelen wanted to upstage the magnetic tricks that were 
used, although he did rely on magnets himself in the chess 
pieces.</font></p></div><IMG style="Z-INDEX: 100; LEFT: 149px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 1563px" height=215 alt="" src="WolfgangvonKlempelen.jpg" width=162 border=1><IMG style="Z-INDEX: 100; LEFT: 467px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 1502px" height=315 alt="" src="EmpressMariaTheresa.jpg" width=260 border=1>

to the court at the Sh�nbrunn Palace in Vienna. The Turk looked like a turban 
figure sitting behind a short, wooden cabinet with a chessboard. The cabinet was 
approximately 4 feet long, 2.5 feet deep, 3 feet high, and rested on four brass 
casters. Because of this, it could be moved around the room freely to be 
observed from all angles. The cabinet was divided into three doors and had a 
long drawer along the bottom. The wooden figure's right arm rested on the top of 
the cabinet and its left hand held a long Turkish pipe.</p></FONT></div></div>

man would play the white pieces and would make the first move. A large key was 
then used to give the illusion that he was winding up the machine. Kempelen then 
asked for a volunteer to play against it.<br><br>Count Cobenzi was the first 
person to play against the Turk. He was defeated quickly.<br><br>The Turk was an 
aggressive player that could usually defeat most opponents within a half of an 
hour of play. However, The Turk did not always win. There was a time when a man 
by the name of Philidor (considered the finest chess player in Europe) defeated 
the Turk in the summer of 1783, which only increased the automaton's 
popularity.</font></p></div></div>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Turk actually moved the chess 
pieces, and shook his head if an illegal move was made or occasionally knocked 
all the chess pieces off the table when he became angry. The machine had various 
gears, rods, and other parts inside the cabinet, which Klempelen would 
occasionally adjust, but these were all part of the illusion.<br><br>Overnight, 
Klempelen became famous, and he toured the palaces of Europe for the next 13 
years. Many well known figures of the time played against the Turk, such as 
Benjamin Franklin, Catherine the Great, Charles Carroll of Carrollton (the last 
surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence) and the famous Prussian 
King, Frederick the Great, paid a small fortune to learn its 
secret.<br></p></FONT></div><IMG style="Z-INDEX: 100; LEFT: 35px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 3008px" height=252 alt="" src="franklin.jpg" width=174 border=1>

because of The Turk's popularity, it overshadowed his real passion: a device 
that simulated speech.<br><br>At one time, he falsely claimed that it was 
broken. However, this did not work as planned. In 1783, Emperor Joseph II 
ordered him to fix it and go on tour. Von Kempelen exhibited the machine until

in extending the power and promoting the civilization of our
