<h1>Why OpenAerialMap failed where OpenStreetMap succeeded</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">
<div class="GAByline">
           <p>June 24, 2009</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by Nathan Willis</p>
           </div>
           <p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) is an
ambitious project: creating a crowd-sourced, user-editable, free vector map
of the world's roads, footpaths, and trails.  Despite the scale of the task
it has been remarkably <a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/stats/data_stats.html">successful</a>,
with more than 100,000 registered users and more than 29,000,000 <a
href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way">ways</a>.  In 2007, a group
of interested OSM users set out to do the same thing for raster-based
satellite and aerial photography that OSM did for road data &mdash; but
that project, <a href="http://wiki.openaerialmap.org/">OpenAerialMap</a>
(OAM), never reached the same level of success, and <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/talk@openaerialmap.org/msg00011.html">closed
its doors</a> in December of 2008.  Looking back, OAM's creator finds both
technical and social causes for the project's fate, and lessons for the
future.</p>

<p>Christopher Schmidt launched OAM in hopes of building a free replacement
for the copyrighted satellite image layer used by Google Maps.  The OSM
project had struck a deal with <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> to
permit usage of Yahoo's <a
href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Yahoo">aerial image layer</a> in
the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch">Potlatch</a> map
editor, but only for the purpose of editing GPS traces against a satellite
background image: the data was to remain Yahoo's and it could not be
displayed in the OSM web map. A sister project, OpenTopoMap, attempted to
do the same thing for topographic map data, using a similar methodology,
but Schmidt put the greater effort into OAM due to its presumably wider
user-appeal.</p>

<p>OAM's initial map set was a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_program">Landsat</a> layer
donated by <a href="http://www.i3.com/">i-Cubed</a>.  Where aerial
photography was available, OAM would support that instead thanks to its
greatly increased resolution.  The project chose to store its map tiles as
uncompressed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF">GeoTIFF</a>
images in the standardized <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Petroleum_Survey_Group">EPSG:4326</a>
map projection; that way, although more storage space was required than for
a compressed format, the openaerialmap.org server could serve up map tiles
without worrying about the CPU overhead of converting every tile
served.</p>

<p>By the middle of 2008, however, things had started to slow down.
Although there were scores of free, often public-domain aerial data sets,
they were not organized or easy to work with: many in the U.S. belonged to
individual state or county government projects, running on legacy systems
&mdash; 
if online at all &mdash; in different projections, and in inconvenient file
formats like the proprietary <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrSID">MrSID</a>.  On top of that, the
data began to grow faster than the disk space on the donated server could
keep up with.</p>

<h4>The technical dimension</h4>

<p>By the time Schmidt decided to pull the plug on the project, he had
uploaded ten terabytes of map data, which was only a fraction of what was
available &mdash; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) generously offered to
donate its entire aerial data set of the United States, which would have
taken up more than 100 terabytes of <em>compressed</em> storage.</p>

<p>It is possible that a benefactor could have been found to donate storage
hardware, but that was not the only technical hurdle.  Converting the data
sets from their original form into the standard adopted by OAM was a
time-consuming process, and one that varied from data set to data set,
Schmdit said.  "<span>We wanted to have large mosaics, EPSG:4326 projected,
as GeoTIFFs. Building that kind of tileset out of hundreds, or thousands,
of small MrSID files requires significant resources. Just loading MrSID
itself can be a beast since MrSID is closed source and not built into many
tools.</span>"</p>

<p>MrSID (mutli-resolution seamless image database) is a wavelet-based
geographic image file format, created and patented by map software company
<a href="http://www.lizardtech.com/">LizardTech</a>.  Each file can be
extracted in multiple resolutions and quality levels, and sub-blocks of the
image can be extracted without reading the entire file.  The format is
popular in commercial applications, but there is no open source
implementation.  Several free tools can decode MrSID to convert it to other
formats.</p>

<p>In contrast to the process required to convert a MrSID archive to
GeoTIFF, OpenStreetMap map-making requires the comparatively straightforward
conversion of GPS traces to OSM ways.  From the beginning of OAM, Schmidt
undertook the lion's share of this "<span>technical gruntwork</span>"
himself, rather than building software tools to automate the process for
end users.  In retrospect, he reflected, that decision severely hindered
the development of a community around the project.  "<span>The system was
simply not designed for users, because it was kind of a one man show. My
lack of delegation skills is apparent in many of the things I do
:).</span>" A handful of users got up to speed on the conversion process,
he added, but most simply gave pointers to available data sets and waited
for someone else to take care of them.</p>

<h4>The social dimension</h4>

<p>Without easy-to-use conversion tools, the number of contributors to the
project remained low, but, Schmidt said, the task of building a raster
graphics map did not lend itself towards community participation either.
In OSM, large data set imports are rare; the majority of the contributions
come from individual users collecting GPS traces of their local
surroundings, and editing their local map.</p>

<p>In spite of having similar goals, OAM found itself in almost the exact
opposite situation.  "<span>Aerial imagery gathering doesn't lend itself to
crowdsourcing the same way vector data gathering does,</span>" Schmidt
said, "<span>Almost all of your data is going to be big dumps from state
agencies and the like.</span>" A few users collected their own aerial
photos with kites or drones, he said, but their images amounted to just a
tiny fraction of the total.</p>

<p>"<span>I think the important thing is to let people take ownership of
what they're doing,</span>" Schmidt remarked.  Without the level of direct
participation found in the OSM project, users did not feel like they
"owned" the final product.  "<span>Looking back, I can see a lot of places
to build community, but at the time, I wasn't really interested in building
a community, and by the time that I realized I was burnt out, there was
already an expectation that things would just 'magically happen'.</span>"
Consequently, when Schmidt decided he <em>was</em> burnt out, there was no
one else ready to take on the task of stewarding the project.</p>

<h4>The next level</h4>

<p>Although he switched off the openaerialmap.org tile server in December
2008, Schmidt has not stopped thinking about OAM, and how to grow a
community around it.  "<span>The desire for easy to find an access aerial
imagery is definitely there. The continued interest in OAM even after the
web frontend essentially stopped working speaks to that, and the continued
attempts to participate even with terrible documentation, poor setup,
etc.</span>"</p>

<p>He is considering re-launching the project with a different set of goals
and different ways of attracting user participation, placing less emphasis
on serving as a single-source repository of image tiles.  Instead, OAM
could function like a directory for the existing aerial imagery map sets
hosted elsewhere, like the approach taken by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service">Web Map Service</a>
(WMS) directory <a href="http://www.wms-sites.com/">wms-sites.com</a>.
Such a service would be almost as useful as serving the tiles themselves,
he said, since so much of the difficulty now is in <em>finding</em> the data
set for a particular area.</p>

<p>Building a wiki-like directory that points to data hosted elsewhere
might also allow users to build "ownership" of their contributions, Schmidt
added.  "<span>The imagery is only a first step towards the end result.
Does the imagery have metadata about it?  Is it aligned properly?  Do
people know how to find it?</span>" Most often, he said, the only way to
find a data set is search the web, and then the results have no user
interface, "<span>just an open FTP site linked from one page under 'GIS
Data'.</span>"</p>

<p>The mapping agencies are usually helpful, he said, but do not have the
manpower or IT resources to run a WMS or tile server.  "<span>This is why
I'm thinking a catalog approach might work: if you let the people who
maintain this imagery at places like <a
href="http://www.mass.gov/mgis/">MassGIS</a> contribute to a site
information *about* the imagery &mdash; concentrating on things like
quality, capture dates, etc. &mdash; you can have them have a product they
can feel like they're the owner of.</span>"</p>

<p>Although he has not taken any formal steps toward this goal, it is
undeniable that there is latent interest in resurrecting the OAM project in
some form.  The map server is down, but the OAM wiki remains up, and other
users have started a discussion page to brainstorm ideas for the future of
the project.  Its main archive is off-line, but people continue to find the
mailing list via third-party sites and write in to ask questions.</p>

<p>Rarely does an open source software project that has failed to get off
the ground take a serious look at <em>why</em> &mdash; although the
benefits of doing so are clear.  Schmidt's assessments of what went wrong
with the first incarnation of OAM will help make the next effort more
technically prepared, and better matched to the user community it needs in
order to build up critical mass and thrive.  Similarly, looking back at how
the practical differences between raster and vector mapping led OAM down a
completely different path than OSM (in spite of their seemingly similar
goals) is an object lesson other projects would be wise to study as
well.</p><hr width="60%" align="left">

Maybe there could be some collaboration with the Marble team <br>
(<a href="http://edu.kde.org/marble/">http://edu.kde.org/marble/</a>) ?<br>
They are probably interested in this, and Marble is no one-man-show.<br>
