Linked was an <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/18/socioclean/">article</a> that was posted a month ago about a Facebook application called <a href="http://socioclean.com/" target="_blank">Socioclean</a> that looks at your Facebook profile and makes a list of inappropriate items. I tried it myself and ended up getting &#8220;D&#8221;, however I don&#8217;t really find it very accurate. The application looks for possibly inappropriate keywords, however in many cases, the context was harmless. For example, &#8220;wasted&#8221; showed up in my report, but it was in a comment made by a friend that was expressing how she felt she had wasted her entire day by oversleeping. I also found it interesting that many of the inappropriate keywords were ones used by friends and NOT myself. Regardless, it is on my profile and I should more aware about the content being expressed on it.</p>
<p>This basis of this application reminds me of a previous reading for class, in which an experiment was done to gain an understanding of how users present themselves. The researchers ultimately categorized users into three categories: College Days, Dressed to Impress, and Living in the Business World. What stands out to me, however, was the description of someone in the College Days group:</p>
<blockquote><p>
DiMicco, J. &amp; Millen, D. (2007). Identity management: Multiple presentations of self in Facebook. Proceedings of the <i>2007 international ACM conference on Supporting group work</i>. Recieved from http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1316682.</p>
<p>Three of the individuals we interviewed followed the patterns we saw in the College Days segment of profile pages. When questioned about issues of identity management and concerns about coworkers and managers viewing their profiles, these users were unconcerned because they considered Facebook to be outside of the context of the workplace. A particularly representative interviewee was Ben (pseudonym):</p>
<p>Ben is in his early 20&#8242;s and joined the company as a full time software engineer in January 2006. He is an active Facebook user, beginning in 2005, checking every day, multiple times a day. He primarily uses the site for maintaining friendships with close, but geographically distant, friends. He has over 200 friends on the site, 35 of which are employees he met at new hire events. When he joined the company, he did not change anything about his profile or the pictures of himself. His current profile links to many photos of him drinking alcohol (including directly out of a beer keg) and attending numerous college parties. <b>He feels that Facebook is “for fun” and relates only to “personal life” and hopes that if his manager ever did see this page would understand that it has “nothing to do with his professional life.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p>While I understand Ben&#8217;s point of view, I find it entirely naive. You may hope that your manager would understand your drunken fun-filled personal life, but that&#8217;s just not reality. To quote Mashable:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a 2009 Harris Interactive study for CareerBuilder.com, 45% of employers questioned had used social networks to screen job candidates. Thirty-five percent of them decided not to hire a candidate based on what they found.</p></blockquote>
<p>So regardless if an employer sees your inappropriate pictures and tries not to judge, I believe there to still be an impression made subconsciously. Maybe Ben&#8217;s priorities leads him not to care. Or perhaps he wouldn&#8217;t want to work for someone that would judge you based on your online identity. I then wonder what percentage of users in this College Days group has the same perception as Ben, and if the reason this is so is due to their own personal priorities or something else?</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s put it to a poll. How often do you censor the content on your FB profile?<br />

			<div class="content">
				<p>After writing my literature review for TECH621, there are several items I would like to mention. Some comments, some questions, and probably some excuses.</p>
<p>First, in class today, it was asked if anyone had compiled a Research Question yet. I was somewhat surprised of the uncertainty of hands.  I can&#8217;t imagine how anyone could ever write a literature review without one. I had a tremendous struggle trying to decide what to do. I read articles, came up with a research question, read more articles, scrapped my research question, lather, rinse, repeat. I must have done away with fully-formed research questions at least four times, each one causing me more stress than the last. I went from wanting to discover the way changes in design affected user participation in SNS, to exploring which Facebook features attracted which specific demographic the most. But I knew I didn&#8217;t have time to conduct surveys for that knowledge, and I knew my time was dwindling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_204" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://lewilliams.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/photo.jpg"><img src="http://lewilliams.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/photo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" title="AngelHelps" width="300" height="224" class="size-medium wp-image-204" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My cat providing moral support through this stressful endeavor. &lt;3</p></div>Second, I&#8217;m ultimately unsure if the research topic I chose was a good one. I wanted to focus on the design of social network sites because I&#8217;m interested in it, and I knew I had to use Radian 6, so I tried to come up with ways I could come up with data from that. With help, I came up with the idea of using the comments and complaints of Facebook users on the design changes of their website. But if that was my answer, what was my question? </p>
<p>After more tossing of possible research questions, I finally decided that I wanted to contribute to future designs of SNS, and came up with the topic of discovering what features of SNS do Facebook users value most. I felt pretty confident about it. One of the first article we read in class were about SNS, and I was able to find that same article referenced in many related papers. That is, I felt confident until last Sunday, when I discovered a single detailed article on users and their gratifications toward using Facebook and it&#8217;s features. It was a 2008 study, and truth be told, I&#8217;m a little scared that it&#8217;s too recent to say that it&#8217;s not timely enough.</p>
<p>Granted, Facebook has gone through two redesigns since 2008, bringing about new features such as the &#8220;Like&#8221; button, Usernames, Places, and Questions. But is that enough to say that another experiment is in order? Could I possibly leverage my point with the innovative methodology of using Radian 6 to acquire data? I&#8217;m not exactly sure how I would go about that though.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I tried what I could, but I feel that my finished review was not as strong as I had hoped. Perhaps it&#8217;s because it is my first time writing one on my one. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I couldn&#8217;t read effectively enough despite the tips I received. Regardless, what I&#8217;m hoping for most is feedback on how to get better. I focused on making my topic transitions smooth and logical, hoping that I was making a point that was getting across, but I feel that there are other topics I should have touched on, without really knowing what those topics were.</p>
<p>I talked about SNS and their definition, the popularity of Facebook and its many design changes, how changes in design alters user perception and use, and then the findings from the 2008 study that was most related to my own topic. I stressed that technology changes quickly and the importance of keeping up with that trend. I mentioned the value of users&#8217; comments and the benefit of the study for designers.</p>
<p>But what other topics should I have covered to support my point? Which part of the topics I did cover should I have provided sources on? Or should I focus on tweaking the research question I have now to go a different direction?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking away a lot from this class but not without struggles, so if you have input please share. <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1263083266g' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Thanks in advance.</p>

				<p>&#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/xplay" target="_blank">@XPlay</a> says that Adam Sessler is doing autograph signing at 2:45PM!&#8221; I said excitedly to my boyfriend this weekend. &#8220;We HAVE to go.&#8221; </p>
<p>Who is Adam Sessler you may ask? Only the hilarious host of X-Play, a gaming show with reviews, previews, and tips for all your favorite (and hated) video games. But this post isn&#8217;t about my X-Play obsession, nor how I practically stalked Adam Sessler this weekend; it&#8217;s about how Twitter allowed me to do it! Well, to an extent. <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1263083266g' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I may have only started to see the benefit of Twitter with the introduction of this semester&#8217;s TECH621 class on Social Media, but it wasn&#8217;t until I spent this past weekend at the PAX East game convention in Boston, MA, that I truly was glad to have it access to it.</p>
<div id="attachment_179" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://lewilliams.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/196482_10100303608952158_13749012_58959539_6757537_n.jpg"><img src="http://lewilliams.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/196482_10100303608952158_13749012_58959539_6757537_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="WelcomePAXEast" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-179" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Welcome to PAX East!</p></div>
<p>Being connected to game companies, creators, reporters, and others, such as <a href="http://twitter.com/insidegaming" target="_blank">@InsideGaming</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/g4tv" target="_blank">@G4tv</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/official_pax" target="_blank">@Official_PAX</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pax_lines" target="_blank">@PAX_lines</a>, etc. gave me the when and where for any events during my stay in Boston. I would be cruising the Exhibition Hall, checking my Tweet feed, when someone would post about a panel I knew I had to attend. </p>

<p>Because of Twitter, I was able to stay informed with any events, lines, and games that were of interest to me. I checked it often and was not only able to make it to panels of game creators, but attended a cosplay gathering for some great pictures! </p>

<p>I also attended a Meet-Up with some 4PlayerPodcast fans, where I was able to make some new friends as we walked from the convention center to downtown Boston &#8211; something that I would not have had the opportunity to do if I hadn&#8217;t seen their last-minute tweet.</p>
<div id="attachment_180" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://lewilliams.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/190526_10100303588363418_13749012_58959122_6002893_n.jpg"><img src="http://lewilliams.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/190526_10100303588363418_13749012_58959122_6002893_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="Boston" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The City of Boston</p></div>
<p>I had a great time at PAX East, and I truly believe that Twitter had a help in enriching that experience. I really have a different view of it now and have also found that instead of asking if someone uses Facebook, I&#8217;ve taken to asking for Twitter accounts&#8230; Seems a bit less personal and therefore, more accessible. But I&#8217;ve learned that just because you make a friend in reality and follow them on Twitter, it doesn&#8217;t mean that they will do the same to you. I guess that quality of Facebook was sort of nice &#8211; having a mutual &#8220;friendship&#8221; instead of a one-sided &#8220;follower&#8221; leaves me feeling less rejected.</p>
<p>On another note, due to my new-found appreciation for Twitter, I have decided to spread it&#8217;s advantages to others. I encouraged my younger sister <a href="http://twitter.com/anwrooty" target="_blank">@anwrooty</a> to get an account, focusing how easy it has been to spread the word about events, which she could possibly utilize for her Cooking Club meetings. Plus, I persuaded my boyfriend <a href="http://twitter.com/jjasicki" target="_blank">@jjasicki</a> to get one, who, as a soon-to-be Purdue graduate, has needed aid in finding a job. I told him stories how one of the students in the class received a possible grant offer after making contacts through Twitter, and how my TECH621 class has free access to Radian 6 for the semester through my professor&#8217;s contact. Networking does has it&#8217;s benefits!</p>

<p>Due to my interest in Interactive Design, I hope to focus on applying concepts to that of this class. Mainly, I am interested in learning more about the design process in the creation of social media, including theories of social presence that may help me further understand the social behavior of the public in CMC. I would like to understand what design traits are currently used in social media sites, and possibly what social affordances should also be included. This then leads me to wonder what is in store for social media in the future, and if we can predict the way in which new social environments and interfaces will be created, using what we know now about user behavior and design standards.</p>
<p>When it comes to Interactive Design, I plan on looking for related areas within that topic. To get an idea of what this may entail, I looked toward Wikipedia to get an idea of similar ones. These interest areas may reveal keywords I could use during my search.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Industrial Design: The core principles of Industrial Design overlap with those of interaction design, and vice versa.These include Physical form of an object, Aesthetics, Human perception &amp; desire, and usability.</p>
<p>Human factors &amp; Ergonomics: Certain basic principles of Ergonomics provide grounding for interaction design. These include anthropometry, biomechanics, kinesiology, physiology and psychology as they relate to human behavior in the built environment.</p>
<p>Cognitive psychology: Certain basic principles of cognitive psychology provide grounding for interaction design. These include mental models, mapping, interface metaphors, and affordances. Many of these are laid out in Donald Norman&#8217;s influential book The Design of Everyday Things.</p>
<p>Human computer interaction: Academic research in human-computer interaction (HCI) includes methods for describing and testing the usability of interacting with an interface, such as cognitive dimensions and the cognitive walkthrough.</p>
<p>Design research: Interaction designers are typically informed through iterative cycles of user research. User research is used to identify the needs, motivations and behaviour of end users. They design with an emphasis on user goals and experience, and evaluate designs in terms of usability and affective influence.</p>
<p>User interface design: Like User Interface design and Experience design, Interaction Design is often associated with the design of system interfaces in a variety of media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time, with a focus on developing the system to respond to the user&#8217;s experience and not the other way around.

				<p>Nov, O., Naaman, M., &amp; Ye, C. (2009). Analysis of participation in an online photo-sharing community: A multidimensional perspective. Journal of the american society for information science and technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Important to understand what drives users to participate and share information.</p>
<p><strong>Variables</strong><br />
Extrinsic motivations: rewards self development and building reputation<br />
Intrinsic motivations: inherent satisfaction from the activity (enjoyment based and obligation based)<br />
Length of membership</p>
<p>Enjoyment<br />
Commitment to the community<br />
Self-development<br />
Reputation gaining<br />
___ with be higher with more participation in the community</p>
<p>Types<br />
Sharing information goods with other in the community<br />
Joining social structures within the community</p>
<p>Analysis<br />
Power-law distribution: few users participation level was high, but most low.</p>
<p>Increased tenure = increased tag/contacts/groups, but decrease with photosharing<br />
Self-development = increased tag/contacts/groups, but decrease with photosharing<br />
Reputation building = only significant to tag/contact/groups, not photos<br />
Commitment = only positive to photos</p>
<p>New members enjoyed more with increased metainformation sharing<br />
Old members enjoyed more with decreased metainformation sharing</p>
<p>New members share more than old<br />
Old member = decreased information sharing</p>
<p>New member share less with more self-development motivation<br />
Old members do not share less with more self-development motivation</p>
<p>New members increased commitment = decreased contact formation<br />
Old members increased commitment = increased contact formation</p>
<p>Conclusion<br />
Better understanding of what factors moderate user participation in communities at various stages of user&#8217;s tenure in the community. This can make better opportunities for design of online communities and services, leading to better sharing of information goods.</p>
<p>People stay for the social aspect of the community and thus continue to participate. But why was photo sharing not increased?

				<p>Oreg, S., &amp; Nov, O. (2007). Exploring motivations for contributing to open source initiatives: The roles of contribution context and personal values.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Software contribution requires expertise where as content contribution does not.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong><br />
What type of open source context activates certain types of motivation?<br />
Who are the contributors and when/where do motivations to contribute arise?</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong><br />
Motivation to contribute to open source software is different than motivation to contribute to open source content</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Contribution Motivations</strong><br />
Intrinsic (inherent satisfaction) and extrinsic motivations (rewards greater than costs)</p>
<p><strong>Motivation degrees</strong><br />
High: desire to establish reputation and gain approval<br />
Mid-range: desire for self-development through learning<br />
Low: altruism, desire to help other in the community</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong><br />
_____ will be higher among open source software contributors than among content ones.<br />
Reputation-building motivation levels<br />
Self-development motivation levels<br />
Altruism motivation levels </p>
<p>There will be a positive correlation between ___ values and the ___ motivation for contributing:<br />
achievement; reputation-building<br />
self-direction; self-development<br />
benevolence; altruistic<br />
universalism; altruistic</p>
<p><strong>10 Motivational Goals (Schartz)</strong><br />
Power, Achievement, Hedonism, Stimulation, Self-direction, Universalism, Benevolence, Tradition, Conformity, Security.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br />
Software context participants higher on reputation-building &amp; self-development.<br />
Content context higher in altruism.</p>
<p>All hypothesis were correct and no controls altered findings.</p>
<p>Reputation building was negatively related to reputation-building<br />
Reputation building was positively related to altruism</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Understanding differences in motivation can help software and content projects utilize the open source model.</p>
<p>Open source software might want to highlight aspects of learning and recognitions</p>
<p>Content-based projects may want to highlight aspects of reciprocity and altruism, such as benefit to the community

<blockquote><p>
Goal to define &#8220;virtual communities&#8221; more. To what extent do people with profiles utilize the affordances of membership, expression, and connection?</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Virtual Communities&#8221;</strong>: social groups that display the psychological and cultural qualities of strong community without physical proximity (Willson, 2006).</p>
<p>Sharing geographic space and self sufficiency &#8211; necessary for &#8220;strong communities&#8221; are not needed for virtual communities.</p>
<p><strong>Common themes between virtual and real communities</strong>:<br />
  1. Collective action (Jones, 1995)<br />
  2. The group thinks of itself as a community (Bell &amp; Newby, 1947)<br />
  3. Members identify with teh community (Willson, 2006)<br />
  4. Share information (Carey, 1989; Jones, 1995)<br />
  5. Larger patterns of interacting grow out of regular information exchange (Bell &amp; Neby, 1974)<br />
  6. Member exhibit attachments to one another and the community more generally (Kantor, 1972; Willson, 2006)</p>
<p><strong>Social Affordances</strong>: possibilities for action that are called forth by a social technology or environment. 3 types are required for the formation of virtual communities on SNS:<br />
   * Membership: Ease and durability of membership<br />
   * Expression: Customizing your page, adding picture, to express yourself<br />
   * Connection: Tools to make a connection like messages, groups, friending</p>
<p><strong>Variables</strong><br />
<em>Membership activity</em><br />
Login time<br />
Public or Private profile</p>
<p><em>Expression</em><br />
Customized page<br />
Profile picture</p>
<p><em>Connectivity</em><br />
Number of friends<br />
Number of comments<br />
Number of days since last comment</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br />
<em>Membership activity</em><br />
Equal login time, except people in a relationship moreso than singles<br />
More females set profile to private than men</p>
<p><em>Expression</em><br />
More than 2/3 did NOT customize their page<br />
Younger and people in a relationship were more likely to customize pages<br />
People in relationships were more likely to have a profile picture</p>
<p><em>Connectivity</em><br />
No significant difference in any demographic</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong><br />
Majority of users do not utilize the social affordances necessary to the formation of virtual communities. Qualities of a community are experienced by a small portion of users. More engaged users that did have virtual communities were based of pre-existing ones. Virtual communities are simply the online extension of geographically situated offline communities

<blockquote><p>
Argues dimensions of task interdependence, authority control, and group focus underpin behaviors. Results in &#8220;lightweight&#8221; behaviors (weak-tie) and &#8220;heavyweight&#8221; behaviors (strong-tie)</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong><br />
Understand operation of internet based collaboration enterprises<br />
Answer questions:<br />
   * What is the optimal structure for contributory practices?<br />
   * How should social and technical systems be designed to promote contribution and participation?</p>
<p>Commons-based peer production (Benkler)</p>
<p><strong>Crowdsourcing</strong>: gaining inputs from many, unknown and unconnected contributors</p>
<p><strong>LWPP</strong> (Lightweight peer production): large set of contributors each of whom provides minimal addition to the product whole. Contributors have little commitment. Allows for many people participating. Appeal to procedure and rules. Straightforward contribution, easy to learn rules. <strong>Overall</strong>: Individual, discrete, pooled contributions, recognized on lightweight quantitative assessment of contributions.</p>
<p><strong>HWPP</strong> (Heavyweight peer production): commitment and attention and action from contributors. Wants to sustain the direction and viability of the community. Equal attention to product and operation. Long term activity. Participants turn to other participants and contributions to determine their own contributions. Require greater learning. <strong>Overall</strong>: Long-term commitment to common cause and community functions with contributions differentially valued through member assessments<strong></p>
<p>Distinguishing types</strong><br />
Primary: Contribution Type, Granularity, Authentication<br />
Secondary: Individual to group focus<br />
Third: Recognition, reputation, and reward.<br />
<strong><br />
Conclusion</strong><br />
Provides input for design of systems that follow the models.

				<p>Howe, J. (2006). The rise of crowdsourcing. Wired Magazine, 14(6). Received from <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Crowdsourcing</strong> is the act of outsourcing tasks, traditionally performed by an employee or contractor, to an undefined, large group of people or community (a crowd), through an open call.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is hiring someone to perform a task until it is finished. Crowdsourcing is bringing outside people and involving them in a collaborative process to complete a task.</p>
<p><u>1. The Professional</u><br />
Claudia Menashe discovers iStockphoto for stock images she needed for an avian flu kiosk. Mark Harmal, a freelance photographer, no longer offers a scarce product, and had to do more work to earn less than he usually does because of iStockphoto. Getty Images then bought iStockphoto, marketing bulk purchases to companies. Crowdsourcing has altered the future for stock photography.</p>
<p>Technological advances in everything from product design software to digital video cameras are breaking down the cost barriers that once separated amateurs from professionals.</p>
<p><u>2. The Packager</u><br />
VH1 Web Junk 20 crator, Michael Hirschorn, needed licensing for viral videos, which was becoming harder to do. VHI&#8217;s partner company, Viacom, purchased iFilm, which sorted licensed viral videos by popularity, for cheap!</p>
<p>Hirschorn predicts more user-generated pieces in TV2.0 because of the successful ratings. There&#8217;s a lot of participation, but not always great content in what the crowd sends. Hischorn predicts that users will provide better content as user-generated TV matures.</p>
<p><u>3. The Tinkerer</u><br />
The &#8220;strength of weak ties&#8221; (Granovetter) powers InnoCentive, a network aimed to solve scientific problems for companies/seekers. Successful because of the broad range of information, knowledge, and experience.</p>

<p><strong>Response</strong><br />
I thought this article was a great example of crowdsourcing, and had never really considered the how the rising trend in such websites like Flickr would affect other professions negatively. Companies and sites that utilize the power of crowdsourcing prove to be innovative and a smart move as technology develops further and more resources are becoming available on the web.</p>
<p>This trend remind me of our previous class discussion on Web 2.0, recognizing the power of public collaboration and communication, not to mention the rise of cloud computing and other computer-mediated communications. Users are putting more of their own resources and information on the web, which seems to facilitate not only communication but is starting to reshape current industries today. I wonder to what extent will professions no longer be necessary, as numerous cheaper alternatives appear online.</p>

				<p>Surowiecki, J. (2005). The Wisdom of Crowds. New York: Anchor Books.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>&#8220;Wisdom of Crowds&#8221;</strong>: Collective intelligence. Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.</p>
<p><strong>Boundedly Rational</strong>: Due to less information and limited foresight, we lack the desire to make sophisticated cost-benefit calculations and settle with a decision that seems good enough, rather than the best possible. (Herbert Simon)</p>
<p>Chasing the expert is a mistake, and a costly one at that. We should stop hunting and ask the crowd instead. But many don&#8217;t agree with collective intelligence and instead believe in only a select few to be smart enough.</p>
<p><strong>3 Problems</strong><br />
   * Cognition Problems: problems that have definitive solutions<br />
   * Coordination Problems: problems that require members of a group to figure out how to coordinate their behavior with each other, knowing that everyone is trying to do the same.<br />
   * Cooperation Problems: problems involving the challenge of getting self-interested, distrustful peopl to work together.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions for the crowd to be wise</strong>:<br />
   * Diversity of opinion: each person should have some private information, even if it&#8217;s just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts<br />
   * Independence: people&#8217;s opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them<br />
   * Decentralization: people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge<br />
   * Aggregation: some mechanism exists for turning private judgmetns into a colelctive decison<br />
The best collective decisions are product of disagreement and contest.</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong><br />
   * Submarine &#8220;Scorpion&#8221; lost and found through average of collective guesses<br />
   * Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? crowd 91% of the time correct<br />
   * Students average guesses 94% correct<br />
   * Agents in maze averaged the same as the smartest individual&#8217;s steps<br />
   * Challenger disaster caused by company Morton Thiokol, as predicted by stock market (Mulherin)<br />
   * Gambling and betting on horses, NFL, etc. predicting outcome of game<br />
   * Google searches and displays by importance<br />
   * IEM poll for presidential elections; the percentage X is going to win = money you receive<br />
   * Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX)<br />
<strong><br />
Decision Market</strong>: Method for capturing collective wisdom
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong><br />
My initial thought to this study was surprise that crowds could practically predict the outcome of certain situations. It&#8217;s somewhat hard to imagine that several hunches put together and averaged could come up with a close estimation of, for example, the weight of an ox. However, at the same time, it seemed to me that a lot of theoreticians had so little faith in the capability of the common man, claiming that there are only a very few number of people that are adept at any one thing. Regardless, the case studies presented were good examples of the wisdom of crowds, but while the crowd may be intelligent as a collection, I wouldn&#8217;t leave it up to the public to decide everything.</p>
<p>When connecting the wisdom of crowds to social media, I would imagine that utilizing social media to find a consensus of what the population is saying about different subjects, trends, etc. would be a possible way to predict certain future trends. The act of using Radian 6 to collect data suddenly seems more valid now&#8230;</p>
