<div class="aip-paragraph">The Galaxy Zoo citizen science website invites anyone with an Internet connection to participate in research by classifying galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As of April 2009, more than 200,000 volunteers have made more than 100 million galaxy classifications. In this article, we present results of a pilot study into the motivations and demographics of Galaxy Zoo volunteers and define a technique to determine motivations from free responses that can be used in larger multiple-choice surveys with similar populations. Our categories form the basis for a future survey, with the goal of determining the prevalence of each motivation.</div>

The Galaxy Zoo citizen science website invites anyone with an Internet connection to participate in research by classifying galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As of April 2009, more than 200,000 volunteers have made more than 100 million galaxy classifications. In this article, we present results of a pilot study into the motivations and demographics of Galaxy Zoo volunteers and define a technique to determine motivations from free responses that can be used in larger multiple-choice surveys with similar populations. Our categories form the basis for a future survey, with the goal of determining the prevalence of each motivation.

A survey to principals of high schools without astronomy points to the conditions needed to increase the number of high school astronomy courses and acceptable justifications for adding in a course. The former includes the need for more and better trained teachers, changing the perceptions of higher officials from local administrations to Federal-level legislators and education department officials, more funds, locally a need for students to show enough interest as well as a curriculum that hel...</p></div>

We discuss collecting data simultaneously from many different instruments, including both qualitative and quantitative sources. A list of instruments used is provided, and data collection methods are described. Many practical logistical concerns are discussed, warning of potential pitfalls to be avoided. This article is intended to be a practical guide for other research groups wishing to use data from multiple sources, especially if they have not collected qualitative data before.

<div class="aip-paragraph">Science educators are increasingly recognizing the key role that participation in authentic scientific practice plays in science education (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Michaels, Shouse, and Schweingruber 2008<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c14" rel="c14" name="citeref_c14">14</a></sup></span>). Participation in scientific research can have many advantages for learners, including a first-hand experience with the scientific process, an increase in knowledge about the research topic (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Brossard <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2005<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c7" rel="c7" name="citeref_c7">7</a></sup></span>), and an increase in scientific thinking (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Trumbull <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2000<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c20" rel="c20" name="citeref_c20">20</a></sup></span>). However, non-experts often find high barriers to participating in genuine scientific research, such as the need for deep understanding of scientific content and methods, difficulty in accessing data and tools, and inability to make contact with professional scientists who could serve as mentors (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Scott, Asoko, and Leach 2007<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c17" rel="c17" name="citeref_c17">17</a></sup></span>; <span class="bibciteref_collection">Sung <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2003<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c19" rel="c19" name="citeref_c19">19</a></sup></span>; <span class="bibciteref_collection">Hawkins 1978<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c9" rel="c9" name="citeref_c9">9</a></sup></span>). Some of these barriers can be lowered when learners work with researchers by participating in carefully planned citizen science activities.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The practice of “citizen science” involves members of the public (“citizen scientists”) working with professional scientists to complete a research project. The American Association of Variable Star Observers (<span class="bibciteref_collection">AAVSO<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c23" rel="c23" name="citeref_c23">23</a></sup></span>) (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Williams 2001<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c22" rel="c22" name="citeref_c22">22</a></sup></span>) and the Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Root 1988<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c15" rel="c15" name="citeref_c15">15</a></sup></span>) have both successfully partnered citizen scientists with professional scientists for more than a century, producing research results that could not otherwise have been achieved. More recently, the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology has recruited birdwatchers as citizen scientists for published studies of the distribution of bird populations in North America. These studies would have been impossible without participation of citizen scientists (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Bonney 2008<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c4" rel="c4" name="citeref_c4">4</a></sup></span>; <span class="bibciteref_collection">Bhattacharjee 2005<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c3" rel="c3" name="citeref_c3">3</a></sup></span>).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The availability of large scientific data sets through the Internet has allowed citizen science projects to engage volunteers in new ways. In addition to collecting data, citizen scientists can analyze existing data, including data from modern astronomy surveys and missions.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">In this article, we discuss an online citizen science project called Galaxy Zoo. This project asks volunteers—self-styled “Zooites”—to morphologically classify selected images of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As of April 2009, more than 200,000 people from 113 countries had been involved in making more than 100 million classifications of galaxies. These results are being used in more than 50 research projects that have thus far produced 16 articles accepted or submitted to peer-reviewed journals (see http://www.galaxyzoo.org/story for an up-to-date list of science articles accepted and submitted using data from Galaxy Zoo).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The Galaxy Zoo project offers two interfaces. Galaxy Zoo (GZ1; http://zoo1.galaxyzoo.org) asks users to determine if a galaxy is spiral or elliptical and to determine the rotation direction of spirals (see Figure <span class="figref_collection"><a class="figref" href="#f1" rel="f1" name="figref_f1">1</a></span>). For a fuller discussion of Galaxy Zoo 1, including a statistical discussion of the accuracy of classifications made by volunteers, see <span class="bibciteref_collection">Lintott <span class="etal">et al.</span> (2008)<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c12" rel="c12" name="citeref_c12">12</a></sup></span>. A newer project, Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2; zoo2.galaxyzoo.org), presents users with more detailed questions about a subset of 250,000 galaxies; GZ2 will be the subject of a future series of articles.</div><div class="figure" id="f1"><a href="/cmlink/scitation.journals.AERSCZ.9.1.010103.1.FIGURE_f1?figurecutoff=2007&amp;issueYear=2010" class="launchMedia"><img src="/FEWebservices/ImagesWebservice?id=AERSCZ000009000001010103000001&amp;type=thumbnail&amp;fid=1" alt="Figure" class="figimg"/></a><div class="caption"><span class="figname">Fig 1. </span>

</div></div>
<div class="sectionWrapper"><div class="section" id="s2"><h1>HISTORY OF GALAXY ZOO PARTICIPATION</h1>

<div class="aip-paragraph">The GZ1 website launched on July 8, 2007. As part of its launch, principal investigator Chris Lintott appeared on BBC’s morning radio program, “Today,” on July 11, and the project was reported on the BBC News website (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6289474.stm). The project was also announced via his blog, “Chris Lintott’s Universe” (www.chrislintott.net).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">News of the project was quickly picked up across print and online media, with articles appearing in print in <em class="emphitalic">The Christian Science Monitor</em> and the <em class="emphitalic">Boston Globe</em>, and online on <em class="emphitalic">The (London) Times Online</em>, <em class="emphitalic">badastronomy.com</em>, and <em class="emphitalic">universetoday.com</em>, as well as in many other print and online media. As a result of this publicity, news of the project quickly spread—especially via online media—and participation increased drastically.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Almost immediately after the BBC radio show coverage aired, tens of thousands of volunteers joined. By the end of the next day (July 12, 2007), nearly 1.5 million classifications had been completed by more than 35,000 volunteer classifiers. For comparison, a graduate student working on a related project was able to classify a sample of 50,000 galaxies in one week, but only by devoting himself entirely to the task (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Schawinski <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2007<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c16" rel="c16" name="citeref_c16">16</a></sup></span>). In the nearly 2 years since its original launch, GZ1 has continued to grow, both in number of users and in number of galaxies classified [see Figures <span class="figref_collection"><a class="figref" href="#f2a" rel="f2a f2b" name="figref_f2a">2a</a>,<a class="figref" href="#f2b" rel="f2a f2b" name="figref_f2b">2b</a></span>].</div><div class="figure" id="f2"><a class="figpart_anchor" id="f2a"> </a><a class="figpart_anchor" id="f2b"> </a><a href="/cmlink/scitation.journals.AERSCZ.9.1.010103.1.FIGURE_f2?figurecutoff=2007&amp;issueYear=2010" class="launchMedia"><img src="/FEWebservices/ImagesWebservice?id=AERSCZ000009000001010103000001&amp;type=thumbnail&amp;fid=2" alt="Figure" class="figimg"/></a><div class="caption"><span class="figname">Fig 2. </span>

<div class="aip-paragraph">Hand in hand with the flood of galaxy classifications came a flood of e-mails. In response to this deluge, the Galaxy Zoo team launched a forum to encourage volunteers to communicate with one another and answer each other’s questions (the forum required a separate registration from the main website). The team later launched a blog in which Galaxy Zoo team members (nicknamed “Zookeepers” by volunteers) describe the research they are doing with volunteers’ classifications. As of April 11, 2009, the forum had more than 11,000 members, and the blog receives an average of about 25,000 unique visitors per month. One unanticipated consequence of the Galaxy Zoo Forums was the development of novel collaborative research projects by volunteers (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Cardamone <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2009<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c8" rel="c8" name="citeref_c8">8</a></sup></span>), and the discovery of at least one truly unique object (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Lintott <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2009<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c11" rel="c11" name="citeref_c11">11</a></sup></span>).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The spectacular growth of GZ1 shows that the site was successful in attracting volunteers to classify galaxies. Additionally, some volunteers go beyond the basic task of classifying galaxies to other thoughtful interactions that may lead to increased understanding of science, such as participating in the forum and blog or participating in collaborative research projects</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The success of Galaxy Zoo represents a major opportunity for astronomy research and astronomy education. To take full advantage of this opportunity in future citizen science projects, we must understand what made Galaxy Zoo such a successful project. We must understand what factors motivate volunteers to participate in Galaxy Zoo. By understanding these motivations, we can plan future citizen science projects to appeal to these motivations, potentially maximizing their numbers of participants (and therefore their scientific impact), and increasing public understanding of and participation in science.</div>
</div></div>
<div class="sectionWrapper"><div class="section" id="s3"><h1>THE CITIZEN SCIENCE LANDSCAPE</h1>

<div class="aip-paragraph">As a starting point in trying to understand volunteers’ motivations, we review the existing literature concerning volunteer motivation in citizen science. For a more complete literature review of Citizen Science, see <span class="bibciteref_collection">Bracey (2009)<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c5" rel="c5" name="citeref_c5">5</a></sup></span>.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Citizen science pre-dates the Internet, and early projects involved participants making observations of the natural world that were often reported through the mail. Today, these observations are often reported through the Internet, but they do not require the Internet (for example, see http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/coop.html and http://www.audubon.org/bird/cbc/history.html).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The Internet, however, allows citizen scientists to participate in research in completely new ways. For the first time, large numbers of people are being asked to analyze entirely online data sets rather than to create data sets, and to communicate with others entirely online. An important precursor to the host of new online-analysis citizen science projects is SETI@home (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Anderson <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2002<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c2" rel="c2" name="citeref_c2">2</a></sup></span>), which was launched in 1999. More accurately described as distributed computing, SETI@home asks participants to donate idle time on their home computers to analyze radio telescope data with the hope of discovering signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. In 2006, one of the first entirely online citizen science projects, Stardust@Home (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Mendez 2008<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c13" rel="c13" name="citeref_c13">13</a></sup></span>), invited participants to actively use a web interface to search for dust grains captured in aerogel by a spacecraft sent to study Comet Wild 2. Results from the citizen scientists were used by mission scientists. When a Stardust@Home user discovers a dust grain, he or she is listed as a coauthor on the article announcing the discovery and also is given the privilege of naming the dust grain. The Stardust@Home team also writes a news section of their website communicating their results and plans to volunteers (http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/news.php).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">While citizen science itself has a long history, little research has gone into who makes up the citizen science community and what motivations they have for participating. A few studies appeared in the 1990s, but the majority of the research has only been published in the current decade. Most studies focused on the benefits of citizen science to its participants (both scientists and citizens) and to society. The few studies that also looked at who volunteers are and why they volunteered were conducted with environmental or biology-related projects, and no studies were found that involved completely online projects such as Galaxy Zoo. While this pilot study is the first to study the motivations of volunteers in an online astronomy project, an overview of the existing studies will give some context and background to our study of volunteer motivations.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><span class="bibciteref_collection">Bradford and Israel (2004)<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c6" rel="c6" name="citeref_c6">6</a></sup></span> analyzed the types of volunteers involved in the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) annual survey of Florida beaches for turtle nests. Volunteers participated in a variety of tasks in the sea turtle project, but the most common tasks were to patrol beaches for sea turtle nesting activity and to mark the nests. The researchers administered a survey containing Likert Scale values for 30 motivation-related questions that was returned by 382 volunteers. Volunteers in the FWC survey tended to be older, well-educated, white females. Most people volunteered for more than one reason, but the most popular reason by far was to help and protect sea turtles.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><span class="bibciteref_collection">King and Lynch (1998)<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c10" rel="c10" name="citeref_c10">10</a></sup></span> studied volunteers working at the Ohio Chapter of the Nature Conservancy who participated in a variety of environmental management tasks, including helping with studies of nesting birds. The study used a 14-question survey. The first question provided a list of 12 motivations and asked volunteers to check those that applied to them. Another question asked volunteers to report which single motivation applied most to them. A total of 86 people responded to the survey. The researchers found that these volunteers were mostly middle-aged, well-educated, fairly affluent white males. About three-quarters of this group worked full-time, and 40% had completed a graduate degree. Most respondents checked multiple motivations for volunteering, but when choosing the single motivation that was most important to them, 63% said they wanted “to do something for nature.” Other motivations included “to explore career options,” “to help create a better society,” and “to allow the organization to provide more goods/services for less money.”</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">It is important to know whether these findings can be generalized to participants in other types of citizen science projects; for example, projects concerning other areas of science or involving different types of technology, and whether they can be generalized to the new generation of online data analysis citizen science projects such as Stardust@home and Galaxy Zoo. A goal of our study is to determine the demographic characteristics and motivations of participants in the Galaxy Zoo citizen science project. Comparison of our results with results of these studies will show whether the same motivations hold in an online astronomy project.</div>
</div></div>
<div class="sectionWrapper"><div class="section" id="s4"><h1>METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING MOTIVATIONS</h1>

<div class="aip-paragraph">To determine a list of Galaxy Zoo 1 volunteer motivations, we looked for trends in free-form responses gathered during two different solicitations of information. During our first phase, volunteers were asked to respond publicly in the Galaxy Zoo forum (see Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4A" rel="s4A" name="secref_s4A">4A</a></span>), and during the second phase, selected volunteers responded to interviews (see Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4B" rel="s4B" name="secref_s4B">4B</a></span>).</div>
<div class="subsect1" id="s4A"><h2>Forum Survey</h2>

<div class="aip-paragraph">As a preliminary mechanism to learn about volunteers’ motivations from the volunteers themselves, the team created a new topic on the site’s forum titled “What Makes Galaxy Zoo Interesting?” The introductory message to this forum topic, posted by science team member Kate Land, read:</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><bq>
<div class="aip-paragraph">We have been overwhelmed by the awesome response we have had to this project. We feel like we’ve really captured people’s imaginations with Galaxy Zoo, and we’d like to know why.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Please leave us feedback here about why you are taking part. We hope that what we learn from you can be helpful to future projects like ours.</div>
</bq></div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">As of January 22, 2009, the day we downloaded our final data set of forum posts for analysis, this forum message had generated 826 responses. The richness of the forum responses suggested that we should begin a more rigorous study of volunteers’ motivations to participate in Galaxy Zoo. This more rigorous study involved interviewing Galaxy Zoo volunteers and is described below in Sections <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4B" rel="s4B s4C s4D s4E" name="secref_s4B">4B</a>,<a class="secref" href="#s4C" rel="s4B s4C s4D s4E" name="secref_s4C">4C</a>,<a class="secref" href="#s4D" rel="s4B s4C s4D s4E" name="secref_s4D">4D</a>,<a class="secref" href="#s4E" rel="s4B s4C s4D s4E" name="secref_s4E">4E</a></span>. We read the initial forum responses in December 2007 before creating the interview protocol, but a rigorous analysis of the 826 forum posts was conducted only after interview transcripts were analyzed.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsect1" id="s4B"><h2>Selecting Interview Subjects</h2>

<div class="aip-paragraph">After securing permission from the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University, we conducted half-hour interviews with Galaxy Zoo volunteers—volunteers who participated in the citizen science activity (classifying galaxies), but not necessarily in the forum. The goal of these interviews was to generate from the interviewees’ free responses a set of motivation categories from an initial sample of Galaxy Zoo participants. We interviewed 22 people out of a total of about 160 000 Galaxy Zoo volunteers.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">To obtain a pool of interview subjects, we sent out an e-mail solicitation to volunteers who had chosen to register their e-mail with the site and who had not opted out of receiving Galaxy Zoo mailing list e-mails. E-mail solicitations were sent out in four batches of approximately 300–400 e-mails each. We had originally hoped to obtain enough response for about 20 interviews from the first batch of solicitations, but getting this amount turned out to require four separate attempts. This solicitation was consistent with the Galaxy Zoo privacy policy, which states that volunteers may be contacted for the purpose of research into the site’s operation. The total number of volunteers who received solicitations for interviews was 1,336.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">One potential area of concern was the question of whether we might contaminate further studies into volunteers’ motivation by soliciting some volunteers for interviews in this study, then asking those same volunteers about their motivations in a future survey (Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s5" rel="s5" name="secref_s5">5</a></span>). However, the large size of the Galaxy Zoo volunteer population mitigates this concern. When the first e-mail solicitation was sent on April 1, 2008, the number of volunteers had risen to 137,228, and by the time the last solicitation was sent on August 24, 2008, it had grown to 161,961. The 1,336 volunteers who received e-mail solicitations to participate in the interviews described here are less than 1% of the overall Galaxy Zoo volunteer population, meaning that less than 1% of our population will potentially be asked about their motivations twice. We believe that this will not pose a significant threat to the internal validity of either this study or the survey study that will follow.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">As an inducement for participating in an interview, we promised to send five interview subjects, selected at random, a copy of an astronomy book signed by the authors, one of whom is a Galaxy Zoo research team member. E-mails to use as contacts for this offer were kept separately from all information used in this study, with no links between subjects’ interview transcripts and their e-mails.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">When volunteers responded to the e-mailed interview request, a mutually convenient time was set for an interview. Interviews were scheduled to take half an hour. As mentioned above, interviews were conducted with 22 subjects. (An additional 21 people offered to participate, but either did not return e-mails or could not find a mutually convenient time for both interviewer and interviewee to talk.) Table <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t1" rel="t1" name="tableref_t1">1</a></span> shows demographic characteristics for all participants included in the study.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsect1" id="s4C"><h2>Interview Protocols</h2>

<div class="aip-paragraph">Our initial interview protocol is shown in Appendix <span class="appref_collection"><a class="appref" href="#xA" rel="xA" name="appref_xA">A</a></span>. We asked a series of questions about subjects’ demographics, their impressions of the Galaxy Zoo website, their motivations for participating, and their experiences with and definition of science. [The question about definition of science was taken from the <em class="emphitalic">Views on Science-Technology-Society</em> instrument (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Aikenhead and Ryan 1992<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c1" rel="c1" name="citeref_c1">1</a></sup></span>).]</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">As an online project, Galaxy Zoo is likely to attract a technically literate audience. With this audience, we thought that interviews using a technical medium such as instant messaging might be appropriate, and some research shows that instant messaging can be an effective medium for conducting interviews in human-computer interaction research (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Voida <span class="etal">et al.</span> 2004<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c21" rel="c21" name="citeref_c21">21</a></sup></span>). Some subjects were not comfortable using instant messaging software, so phone interviews were conducted with these subjects. The same researcher (Raddick) conducted all interviews, both instant messaging and phone. All phone interviews were recorded and later transcribed. Questions were asked in the same order in the first seven interviews, but in some interviews, questions were skipped to keep the total interview within the half-hour timeframe the volunteer had committed.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">After conducting these seven interviews, with codes A–G, we realized that some questions about participants’ past experiences with and attitudes toward science—questions we considered important—were not being asked in every interview. We therefore changed the order in which questions were asked to bring these questions closer to the beginning of the interview; the revised order is shown in Appendix <span class="appref_collection"><a class="appref" href="#xB" rel="xB" name="appref_xB">B</a></span>. The protocol shown in Appendix <span class="appref_collection"><a class="appref" href="#xB" rel="xB" name="appref_xB">B</a></span> was used to conduct interviews with codes H–V. All the results reported here come from analysis of questions that were asked on both versions of the survey protocol and therefore asked of all subjects. Results of our analysis of questions concerning their experience with and definition of science are left for future work.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsect1" id="s4D"><h2>Analysis of Responses—Creating the Categories</h2>

<div class="aip-paragraph">To ensure that our motivation categories accurately reflected what people said in the interviews, we used a grounded theory approach in which theoretical models—in our case, categories of motivation—emerge from the data (<span class="bibciteref_collection">Strauss and Corbin 1990<sup><a class="citeref" href="#c18" rel="c18" name="citeref_c18">18</a></sup></span>). We began by having two independent raters (Raddick and Bracey) read through the first 12 interviews (those with codes A–L; we chose these 12 because they were the interviews we had already conducted at the time we began this analysis). Each rater read through each interview and identified statements of motivation in the interview transcripts. A statement of motivation is a phrase in the transcript that provides insight into a reason why the subject participated in Galaxy Zoo. Phrases were considered independently; for example, the hypothetical statement, “As a person who loves astronomy, I enjoy looking at pictures of the night sky” would be considered two separate statements of motivation: “A person who loves astronomy” and “I enjoy looking at pictures of the night sky.” Rater #1 (Raddick) identified 79 statements of motivation and rater #2 (Bracey) identified 80 statements of motivation.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Each rater independently wrote the identified statements of motivation onto separate index cards. In many cases, one person used multiple statements to refer to what was later grouped into a single motivation by the raters. In this way, an interview subject might have ten statements of motivation that refer to three motivations. Once the motivational statements were recorded, the raters then shuffled the index cards and sorted them into categories by identifying common themes within the statements of motivation (Tables <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t2" rel="t2" name="tableref_t2">2</a></span>a and <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t2" rel="t2" name="tableref_t2">2</a></span>b). In addition, a third rater (Gay) read through the transcripts of the first ten interviews (those with codes A–J) and identified groups of statements of motivation (e.g., all the phrases related to one motivation) in each interview. The rater then sorted these groups of statements into motivation categories (Table <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t2" rel="t2" name="tableref_t2">2</a></span>c).</div>

<div class="aip-paragraph">In summary, rater #1 identified nine separate motivations from the statements of motivation, rater #2 identified eight separate motivations, and rater #3 identified eight separate motivations. The next step was for the three raters to discuss all these motivations and determine which motivations were stating the same concepts in different words. We concluded that the following identified categories could be combined or split:<div class="aip_itemlist"><ul class="bullet-list">
<li><span class="elementLabel">•</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Rater #2’s “Interested in Science/Astronomy” category was split to correspond to rater #1 and rater #3’s separate “Astronomy” and “Science” categories.</div>
</li>
<li><span class="elementLabel">•</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Rater #1’s “Imagination” category and rater #2’s “Sense of wonder” category were considered aspects of the same motivation expressed by reviewer #3’s “Scale of the Universe” category; this motivation was given the name “Vastness.”</div>

<li><span class="elementLabel">•</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">“Helping” (raters #1 and #2) and “Volunteerism” (#3) were considered the same category, referred to as “Helping.”</div>

</li>
</ul></div></div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">As a result of these discussions, we settled on a list of 12 motivations, and a typical statement of motivation describing each; these statements were used to describe each motivation on our survey. These 12 final motivations are shown in Table <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t3" rel="t3" name="tableref_t3">3</a></span>; the table shows the motivation category names used by the research team and the one-sentence descriptions used in the survey described in Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s5" rel="s5" name="secref_s5">5</a></span>.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Once we settled on this list of 12 motivation categories, the next step was for each of the three raters to code the entire set of interview transcripts, as well as ten additional interviews that were conducted later (those with codes M–V), using these motivation categories. This step allows us to calculate the inter-rater reliability of the categories (Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4E" rel="s4E" name="secref_s4E">4E</a></span>).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">To ensure that we were not missing any major motivation categories, we used the same motivation categories to classify all motivations identified within the forum posts (see Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4A" rel="s4A" name="secref_s4A">4A</a></span>), with an eye toward identifying any missing categories. Within the 826 forum responses, 215 responses contained statements of motivation, and two were thrown out because responders indicated they were under the age of 18. (While we have no way of knowing the ages of other forum responders, we proceeded under the assumption that since the forum posts are already in the public domain, no harm would be done to forum participants who did not provide demographic information and whose motivations were kept separate from their forum username within the spreadsheets we used in our analysis.)</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">After analyzing all forum responses, we did not identify any potentially new motivations that the raters could not independently fit within an existing category. Without being able to crosscheck our list of motivations against a large sample of forum posts, it would have been difficult to conclude that we had a complete list of motivations. Because we did not find any additional motivations in the larger sample of forum posts, we conclude that we do have a nearly complete set of volunteer motivations. In addition, since forum users and e-mail respondents would be affected by different biases, the fact that these different groups share the same motivations adds weight to the generalizability of our samples. Detailed inter-rater reliability and response rates are discussed below.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Both the forum and interview data are limited in ways that make the determination of the frequency of motivations difficult. In the forums, posters often referenced motivations from others’ prior posts in what they said, and the motivation distribution of people who use the forums is not necessarily the same as the motivation distribution of the much larger group of volunteers who only classify galaxies. In addition, although interviews were sought from a randomly chosen set of volunteers who would ideally represent an unbiased sample, we recognize that the sample will, by its nature, only reflect the motivations of people who agreed to be interviewed. In this case, of the 1,336 people we invited to participate, only 22 were interviewed, a response rate of only 1.4 percent. However, the goal of this study was to determine a complete set of motivation categories to be used in further research. Accomplishing this goal does not require us to make any statements about the frequency with which motivations appear in our population.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsect1" id="s4E"><h2>Inter-Rater Reliability</h2>

<div class="aip-paragraph">As a check on inter-rater reliability, we went through the interview transcripts and forum posts and categorized just the first motivation that the volunteer mentioned. Since both these data sets (all interviews and forum posts) required the raters to examine free-form text-based data (either interview transcripts or forum posts), we were able to combine both data sets for the purposes of measuring inter-rater reliability.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Overall, we found that for the complete data set, all three of the raters matched for 644 (76%) classifications, two out of three matched for 175 (21%) of the classifications, and in only 29 cases (3%) was there no agreement. However, these values may not be the best indication of inter-rater reliability. This is because the full data set includes 609 forum posts for which two or more raters indicated that no statement of motivation was present.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">After excluding these items and considering only the remaining 237 responses, we found all three raters matched 98 times (41%) and two out of three matched for 110 (46%) of the items, and no agreement was found in the same 29 (12%) items. This corresponds to a pairwise percent agreement of 56% between raters #1 and #3, 56% between raters #1 and #2, and 58% between raters #2 and #3, as well as a Fleiss Kappa value of 0.474. For the purposes of being able to identify what motivations are present consistently, but not for identifying the frequency of motivations to high accuracy, we consider our results reliable.</div>
</div>
</div></div>
<div class="sectionWrapper"><div class="section" id="s5"><h1>DISCUSSION</h1>

<div class="aip-paragraph">It is important to emphasize that most users do not have a single motivation. After eliminating forum posts that were not relevant (for instance “Thanks for responding” messages), we found the majority of the respondents mentioned more than one motivation within either their interview or forum posting, with the typical respondent listing two motivations (102 forum and seven interview respondents, or 46% of the combined sample of interviews and forum posts). Only 89 (37%) of the 237 posts and no interviews included statements of motivation that all raters could fit into only one category. This is consistent with the previous studies of citizen science volunteer motivation discussed in Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s3" rel="s3" name="secref_s3">3</a></span>, which found that most volunteers reported more than one motivation.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">We examined the motivations in the order they are stated to check inter-rater reliability (Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4E" rel="s4E" name="secref_s4E">4E</a></span>). There will not necessarily be a direct correlation between a respondent’s primary motivation—the motivation that they consider most important—and what they say first. While one might reasonably guess that the order that motivations are listed may correlate to importance of the motivations to the responders, we have no data to check this hypothesis.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">We next looked at the frequencies with which these motivations appeared in our sample (Table <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t4" rel="t4" name="tableref_t4">4</a></span>). As discussed in Section <span class="secref_collection"><a class="secref" href="#s4D" rel="s4D" name="secref_s4D">4D</a></span>, these reported frequencies do not indicate the prevalence of these motivations in the larger volunteer population, but the fact that the motivations appear with reasonable frequency in this sample does give us confidence that these motivations are truly present in the larger population.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><div class="tablegrp" id="t4"><table><thead align="left" valign="bottom"><tr><td class="tableCaptionCell" colspan="13"><span class="tableCapName">Table IV. </span>Frequency of motivations identified in respondents’ interviews or forum posts.

Percentages are based on the number of times among the 207 remaining responses containing a motivation. This includes both the forum posts and the 22 interviews. These frequencies do not indicate the frequencies that these motivations appear in the larger population, but they do give us confidence that these motivations are present in the larger population.</td></tr>

<div class="aip-paragraph">In looking at the distribution of initial responses where two or more raters agreed as shown in Table <span class="tableref_collection"><a class="tableref" href="#t4" rel="t4" name="tableref_t4">4</a></span>, we found that only three responses (after removing “non-pertient”/“no motivation” from the sample) appeared at a 10% or greater level among the list of first-mentioned motivations: Astronomy (39%), Contribute (13%), and Vastness (11%).</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Expanding the sample to include all motivations listed by each person rather than just the first and again only considering cases where two or more raters agreed, we find that these motivations continue to dominate, but more motivations are found in common across more than 10% of the responders.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">The primary goal of this investigation was to identify a list of motivation categories driving participants in the GZ1 project to classify galaxies. We have used these categories to construct a survey instrument that uses multiple-choice and Likert scale responses to assess the frequency of each motivation category in our population. We have administered this instrument as an online survey and are now analyzing the responses. Results of this survey research will be published in a future article.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">While we were able to match all the motivational statements in both the interviews and the forum free responses against the 12 motivation categories, we recognize that our sample has certain biases that may indicate that there are motivations we could not have sampled. Our only comparison data set was posts to the Galaxy Zoo forum; however, only about 5% of all Zooites have a forum account, and not all of those individuals are active within the forums. There may also be unmeasured population differences between those users that self-select to socially and intellectually interact in the forums and users who only classify galaxies. For example, the motivation to participate in GZ1 as a mechanism to make friends is much less likely to be present in people who do not socially engage through the Galaxy Zoo forums. Recognizing that the comparison data set is not an unbiased sample, the survey that we are now conducting will allow users the opportunity to offer a free response motivation in addition to asking them to select the relative importance of each of the previously identified motivations.</div>
</div></div>
<div class="sectionWrapper"><div class="section" id="s6"><h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>

<div class="aip-paragraph">Our method of interviewing participants, identifying motivational statements, and categorizing those statements into a set of overarching motivations produced a list of motivations that was applicable across both an extended interview set and forum posts. We conclude that it is possible to explore the motivations of a large population of citizen scientists through a very small sampling of individuals using interviews, although we recommend using larger interview sets in future studies.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Through interviews of 12 randomly selected GZ1 participants, we were able to identify approximately 80 “statements of motivation” describing reasons why subjects chose to participate in Galaxy Zoo. Three raters classified these statements of motivation, and consensus among the raters led to 12 categories of motivation. Each rater then classified each interview transcript into all the motivation categories that applied to it, noting which motivation category the subject mentioned first. We used these rater classifications to measure the inter-rater reliability of our categories.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">After our initial analysis, we searched for additional motivations in ten additional interviews and in 826 forum posts, and we did not identify any additional motivations. We feel that being able to cross-check our interview based motivations list against the forum posts provided adequate levels of certainty that we have identified a list of motivations sufficiently representative of the majority of Galaxy Zoo volunteers that we can proceed with a broader future study with a larger sample. We are now conducting this study by surveying a large sample of volunteers. Results from this larger study will offer insight into why people choose to participate in citizen science activities, which will be useful in designing future citizen science projects.</div>

<div class="aip-paragraph"><strong class="emphbold">INTERVIEW PROTOCOL FOR GALAXY ZOO STUDY</strong></div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Hello! My name is Jordan and I’ll be asking you a few questions through [Skype/IM/Messenger] today. Thank you for your interest in Galaxy Zoo, and for agreeing to participate in this interview. This interview contains 24 questions, and should take about 30 minutes to complete.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Your responses will help us improve the site to better meet your needs. Before we start, have you read the Information Sheet on the website?</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">[if no:] Please take a moment to read the sheet. You can find it at http://www.galaxyzooblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/interview.swf.</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">If you have any questions as we go, please ask—I’m happy to answer! If you would prefer not to answer a question for any reason, just say “prefer not to answer,” and I will move on to the next question. You don’t have to give a reason. If you would like to end the interview at any time, please let me know. Do you have any questions about this?</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Great, let’s get started! First, let me ask you for some basic data about yourself (5 questions).</div>

<div class="aip-paragraph"><div class="aip_itemlist"><ol class="arabic-num-list">
<li><span class="elementLabel">1.</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">How would you define the term “science”?</div>
</li>
</ol></div></div>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Thanks! Next, I’ll do some “thought experiments.” Imagine that Galaxy Zoo were a little different in the ways I’ll describe. How would that change your opinion of the project, or how much you would want to volunteer?</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><strong class="emphbold">“Thought Experiments”</strong> [note: these will be asked in random order]<div class="aip_itemlist"><ol class="arabic-num-list">
<li><span class="elementLabel">1.</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Astronomers are now analyzing the classifications from Galaxy Zoo users, including you. They will almost certainly discover many interesting things about the universe. But, if you were told that for some reason your classifications were excluded from our study sample, how would that change how you participate in the project? (By the way, this is just hypothetical—all classifications are included in our sample.)</div>
</li>
<li><span class="elementLabel">2.</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Galaxy Zoo depends on people like you choosing to offer their time to classify galaxies. But, if you were told by someone else, such as a boss or a teacher, to participate in Galaxy Zoo, how would that change how you participate in the project?</div>
</li>
<li><span class="elementLabel">3.</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Galaxy Zoo includes about a million galaxies, most of which have been looked at by only a few people. If Galaxy Zoo instead included galaxies that had been extensively studied before, how would that change how you participate in the project?</div>
</li>
<li><span class="elementLabel">4.</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">If Galaxy Zoo did not include a forum, so that you could not interact with other users, how would that change how you participate in the project?</div>
</li>
<li><span class="elementLabel">5.</span>
<div class="aip-paragraph">Some people on the forum have joked that the site is “addictive”—that they can’t help doing “just one more galaxy.” If we changed the interface so that you had to request the next galaxy (rather than getting the next one immediately), how would that change how you participate in the project?</div>

<div class="aip-paragraph">Thank you! Now, let me ask for your opinion on some parts of the website. We are interested in your honest assessments—I didn’t write the site, so don’t worry about hurting my feelings! (4 questions)</div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><strong class="emphbold">Evaluating The Site</strong></div>
<div class="aip-paragraph"><div class="aip_itemlist"><ol class="arabic-num-list">
