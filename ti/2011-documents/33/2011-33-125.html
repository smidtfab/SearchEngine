				<p> In the downturn, many companies have scrambled to change what they do. They&#8217;re quickly added products or services, introduced multiple new versions, marketed to many new audiences. So maybe it&#8217;s time to ask &#8212; are you in over your head? Unfocused? Are you simply doing too much? Some businesses have taken the opposite tack in the downturn, stripping down their company to the bare essentials . They&#8217;re staying laser-focused on what matters most to their customers, creating bare-bones products or services. Then, if demand dictates, they might add one feature or two. This has the advantage of keeping marketing very simple as well. In this time of pinched marketing budgets, that can be a real plus. On the technology side, the do-less idea dovetails with the trend toward lean startups. Shrinking technology-development costs have translated into tech startups either seeking smaller venture or angel funding rounds, or just bootstrapping all the way to profits. Many can get a basic version of their software ready for customers, and are just putting it out. Then, customer feedback may help them gradually add features or alter the audience or direction of the product.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/trends/power-assure-gets-11-25-million-jolt-of-funding.htm">Power Assure Gets $11.25 million Jolt of Funding</a></h2>
				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Jul 14th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/trends/power-assure-gets-11-25-million-jolt-of-funding.htm#respond" title="Comment on Power Assure Gets $11.25 million Jolt of Funding">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> Power Assure , a Santa Clara green IT company, today announced that it scored $11.25 million in venture funding. The round was led by energy efficiency-focused investors Good Energies , and joined by Point Judith Capital and Draper Fisher Jurvetson . Power Assure&#8217;s chief technology officer Clemens Pfeiffer said the company will use this capital to take its technology to a broader market. Its software cuts data centers&#8217; power consumption by half, on average, the company claims. Palo Alto Research Center (formerly known as Xerox PARC) uses Power Assure, but Pfeiffer declined to name other major customers. Founded in 2007, Power Assure took a $2.5 million series A round from DFJ in 2009. It also previously won non-dilutive grant funding including a $5 million grant from the Department of Energy, and a $50,000 cash prize at the 2008 California Clean Tech Open . (In total, the company has raised $18.75 million.) Power Assure&#8217;s software works like &#8220;automatic lights out&#8221; in homes, Pfeiffer says. &#8220;If you have a lot of traffic on your site or a lot of users on your app, then you need to keep a lot of servers in your data center running. During low utilization times  you don’t need them all running. You can use them for other purposes, or in an extreme case sleep or shut them down to save energy and money. That&#8217;s just as long as you can adjust the capacity dynamically.&#8221; Companies that have expressed the most interest in using Power Assure&#8217;s solutions in 2010 have been government organizations &#8220;trying to follow the  mandates of the Obama administration, &#8221; financial services companies &#8220;because of the pressure that they are under to cut costs,&#8221; and companies that operate &#8220;data centers in the ten- to two-hundred-thousand square feet range,&#8221; but may not have achieved the efficiencies of an Amazon or Google yet, according to Pfeiffer. Jonathan Koomey , a consulting professor at Stanford University whose research focuses in part on the growth and environmental impact of data centers , said it&#8217;s a good time to be in the business of green IT services: &#8220;Climate change is becoming a bigger more important part of companies’ risk profiles and planning. And the cost of IT has gone up a lot in the last five years. Computers have gotten cheaper, but things like cooling and power distribution have gotten more expensive to the point where the cost of buying the cooling and backup power is comparable to the cost of a data center&#8217;s IT equipment itself. Companies like [Power Assure] can save a lot of money for businesses that use data centers while reducing emissions. That&#8217;s a good thing, and a reminder that the net effect of using data centers in a rational, sustainable way &#8212; moving bits not atoms &#8212; is actually a positive for the environment.&#8221; CrunchBase Information Information provided by CrunchBase CrunchBase Information Good Energies Information provided by CrunchBase </p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/inside-cloudcrowd-betting-on-credibility-video.htm">Inside CloudCrowd: Betting On Credibility [Video]</a></h2>
				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Jul 13th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/inside-cloudcrowd-betting-on-credibility-video.htm#respond" title="Comment on Inside CloudCrowd: Betting On Credibility [Video]">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> As one of the founders of the original Napster and CloudMark (an anti-spam service), Jordan Ritter , has always been fascinated by the idea of combining the power of the cloud and the potential of human capital. Last April, he met up with Alex Edelstein , a former CloudMark executive, to hammer out their next business plan. Over a round of beers, the idea for CloudCrowd was born. Like CrowdFlower and Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk , CloudCrowd is trying to bring labor into the cloud, by creating a vast network of workers around the globe. Today, there are roughly 25,000 workers, who have completed more than a million tasks since the site&#8217;s launch in October 2009. That represents a small fraction of CrowdFlower&#8217;s claim to 500,000 workers, but CEO Edelstein says their force is quickly expanding, with some 2,000 additions each week. Although it took 7 months to reach the one million task mark, Edelstein predicts they&#8217;ll reach 2 million jobs in 8 weeks. See video above. CloudCrowd has two main segments. The bulk of its business is client-driven work: a company submits tasks to CloudCrowd and the service will farm that out to eligible workers. Workers access CloudCrowd through a Facebook app, where they can pick available tasks and arrange payment.The tasks can be as simple as checking the quality of an image or involve the translation of entire web pages. Because pricing is determined by the level of difficulty, the payouts range from one penny to several dollars. Once a task is completed, a separate user will check the finished product for an additional fee, creating a level of quality control. The second part of their business is a new layer of consumer-facing services. CloudCrowd recently launched EditZen, a simple web site, where consumers can submit pages for editing at $4 a page. The company will soon launch TranslationZen, which will offer translation services at $19.95 a page (far cheaper than some alternatives which are priced at $60 a page). Aside from their consumer services, CloudCrowd&#8217;s cut varies widely depending on the job&#8212; ranging from a 20% cut to as high as 80%. The average worker doesn&#8217;t get paid handsomely for their task, but it can be a nice source for supplemental income&#8212; especially for workers in developing countries where salaries are generally well below America&#8217;s mean. In fact, the company now attracts more workers outside of the US, with a heavy concentration in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (many from Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore). The startup, which has yet to reach profitability, is a 15 person operation in San Francisco with modest funding. So far Edelstein is their sole investor, with $1.5 million in the project, but they are talking to major VC firms about a Series A round. The main challenge for a company like CloudCrowd is keeping pace with its ever-growing workforce. Edelstein admits that feeding the machine with sufficient volume and variety is a difficult endeavor in this early stage. The company has not spent a significant amount of capital on marketing and courting clients, instead, CloudCrowd still relies on word of mouth to attract new business. &#8220;Well it&#8217;s true that the number one complaint of our workers is give me more work, I want more availability of jobs. In both of the previous outsourcing, disruptive eras, the era of manufacturing moving to China and developing nations and the era of white collar work moving to India it took years of explaining, educating and showing corporations and all sorts of people who had work how much they could benefit&#8230;how consistent the work quality could be&#8230;.We don&#8217;t expect that overnight every single company in the Fortune 500 is going to outsource significant amounts of their work to the internet cloud but we&#8217;re sure that it&#8217;s going to happen over time.&#8221; The key to their success (and beating rivals like CrowdFlower) lies in the credibility of their workforce and amassing as much information as possible on the skills of their workers. According to Ritter, the system  is structured to create dynamic profiles on each user. Every time a user completes a task and that task is reviewed, CloudCrowd will learn how reliable that user is and which skills they excel at. If all that information is organized properly, that could be highly valuable for a client who needs to finish a targeted task in a short time frame. &#8221;We&#8217;re building sort of what we call the credibility graph of known reliable people on the internet,&#8221; Ritter says. &#8220;If there are particular customers who&#8230; say, &#8216;I want a thousand reliable people on the internet to do a particular job for me.&#8217; Well today you really can&#8217;t find that. Where would you find 1,000 reliable people on the internet.&#8221; CrunchBase Information CloudCrowd CrowdFlower Jordan Ritter Information provided by CrunchBase </p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/george-steinbrenners-contribution-to-the-business-of-baseball.htm">George Steinbrenner&#8217;s Contribution to the Business of Baseball</a></h2>
				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Jul 13th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/george-steinbrenners-contribution-to-the-business-of-baseball.htm#respond" title="Comment on George Steinbrenner&#8217;s Contribution to the Business of Baseball">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> Tonight at Angels Stadium in Anaheim, Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees will take the field as the starting shortstop for the American League in the 81st annual Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Jeter&#8217;s $22 million annual salary makes him one of the highest-paid players in the game, thanks in large part to his former boss, George Steinbrenner, who bought the entire team in 1973 for less than half that amount, and who died this morning at the age of 80. To say the least, Steinbrenner was a polarizing figure, loved by some for taking an also-ran franchise and restoring it to its former glory, and hated by others for bringing pure, unadulterated capitalism to baseball. But the simple fact remains: The team he bought for $10 million in 1973 (actually 8.8 million after he sold two parking lots thrown in as part of the deal) is now worth an estimated 1.6 billion, nearly $800 million more than the second-place Boston Red Sox, a fact The Boss would no doubt have enjoyed&#8211;as long as they weren&#8217;t ahead of the Yankees in the standings. You don&#8217;t get that level of success without being a tireless innovator, and Steinbrenner was, quite literally, a game-changing force in baseball. But having said that, he also mixed in a healthy dose of bedrock business sense. Love him or hate him, here are just a few things to appreciate. He spent money to make money. These days, you can&#8217;t throw a baseball in any direction without it hitting someone ready to complain about how overpaid the game&#8217;s players are. But just as Steinbrenner was taking over the Yankees, free agency was taking hold in baseball, and he took full advantage. In 1975, he made Catfish Hunter the highest-paid player in the history of the game with a $640,000 annual salary that was more than six times what he had been paid the previous year. After the 1980 season, he signed Dave Winfield to a 10-year, $23 million contract, which again became the highest salary ever paid to a player at the time. Yankee third baseman Alex Rodriguez now makes $10 million more than that&#8211;in one season. But in terms of percentages relative to what the owners are worth, players&#8217; salaries are still well in line with the rest of the business world&#8211;and no one goes to the ballpark to watch the owners, a fact Steinbrenner was quick to recognize as part of the cost of winning. He had a distinct management style. Quite possibly the understatement of the century, but it&#8217;s something every true entrepreneur needs, and Steinbrenner had it in spades. He was famously hands-on as an owner, changing managers 20 times in his first 23 seasons as owner, including firing manager Billy Martin five different times. He publicly called out players&#8211;especially high-priced stars&#8211;when he wasn&#8217;t happy with their performance on or off the field. Then there&#8217;s the Yankees&#8217; famous grooming policy, which to this day doesn&#8217;t allow facial hair other than a mustache, or hair below the collar. Since Steinbrenner took ownership of the team in 1973, only three employees have been continuously employed. He made the right deals with the right people at the right times. The ability to form profitable alliances was at the heart of Steinbrenner&#8217;s innovation&#8211;and of the team&#8217;s success and value. He was the first owner to sell cable TV rights, and when that relationship began to go south, he simply formed his own network. He also signed a 10-year, $97 million contract with Adidas in 1997, the first such contract at the time. Technically, Steinbrenner was just another MLB franchisee, so these sorts of deals often ruffled all the wrong feathers. But they also netted million for Steinbrenner, for the Yankees and, eventually, for all of baseball, and were quickly and widely imitated. He never took himself too seriously. Like many entrepreneurs, Steinbrenner was as much a brand as he was a businessman, and he never shied away from that brand. It started as early as the late &#8217;70s, when he fired Martin as part of a Miller Lite beer commercial, to which Martin responded, &#8220;Not again.&#8221; After he publicly scolded Jeter in the press for partying too much, the two appeared in a Visa ad together club-hopping. He even hosted Saturday Night Live in 1990, dreaming of a Yankees team where he was not only the owner, but also served as the manager and played every position. Steinbrenner was larger than life in the world of baseball, but he was equally transcendent in the world of business. They say that if you&#8217;re not pissing someone off, you&#8217;re probably not very good at your job. So you can hate the Yankees if you want&#8211;plenty of baseball fans do&#8211;but The Boss deserves his due. </p>

				<p> InMobi, the largest mobile ad network that hasn&#8217;t been acquired, has raised another $8 million in funding. The round was led by existing investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield &#38; Byers and Sherpalo Ventures and brings their total raised capital to $15.6 million . We&#8217;ve estimated that the company did around $35 million in revenue in 2009, and may hit $75 million for all of 2010. We&#8217;ve covered this startup a lot recently. In particular they are are extremely well set up for explosive growth in the U.S., a new market for them. From a June post: Today they are probably the second biggest mobile advertising network in the world, with nearly 17 billion monthly impressions combined on mobile apps and mobile websites. Google’s AdMob has 18 billion impressions/month). Most of InMobi’s ad impressions are outside of the U.S. The bulk – 10 billion – are in Asia where the company first launched. 2 billion are in the U.S., where the company has had limited operations since January 2010. Africa takes 2.3 billion, Europe 1.6 billion and the Middle East .5 billion. A full U.S. launch took place last week, and a Japan launch is coming soon. How well will InMobi do in the U.S.? They were bullish before the recent news about Apple taking steps to make it nearly impossible for non-independent advertising networks like AdMob to work on the the iPhone and iPad. We recently interviewed InMobi CEO Naveen Tewari last week to talk about his business. The video is below: InMobi serves advertising in 108 countries today, and reaches 179 million consumers. The company launched in 2007. The entire press release is below: InMobi Raises $8 Million in Series B from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &#38; Byers and Sherpalo Ventures to Fund Expansion and Mobile Customer Discovery Technology SAN FRANCISCO AND LONDON: July 13, 2010: InMobi, the world’s largest independent mobile ad network, today announced that it has secured $8 million in its Series B round from its existing investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield &#38; Byers and Sherpalo Ventures. With this new round, InMobi will focus on its recent US expansion, launch in Japan and continue to grow existing operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa. The company will also double its engineering staff to further enhance its mobile advertising technology platform globally. This new round brings the total funding to more than $15 million. With 16.9 billion impressions monthly reaching 179 million consumers in 108 countries, InMobi offers advertisers, developers, and publishers a dependable global mobile advertising alternative to Google and Apple. From the beginning, InMobi has invested in building a highly scalable, mobile customer discovery ad network leveraging its unique analytics engine AdROItTM to optimize ad serving in real time. The results provide unmatched performance to its current list of marquee partners including Reebok, Microsoft, Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Quaker Oats, Yamaha, Barclays, and Yahoo. “Since our launch in 2007, we have focused on building global expertise in mobile ad serving technology with a highly scalable platform. After market launches in the US and Europe and further expansion in Asia and Africa, our global ad impressions increased from 7.5 billion to 16.9 billion monthly in just six months &#8211; it is clear our strategy is working.” said Naveen Tewari, CEO and Founder of InMobi. “This additional funding will help us capitalize on our early success and enable us to aggressively compete in major advertising markets globally.” At the core of InMobi’s innovation is its technology. Further product developments will redefine the way advertisers, publishers and developers reach consumers and measure performance including detailed analytics that inform the ad serving process in real-time, automatically enhance ROI, and help advertisers maintain a targeted buy at scale globally. &#8220;InMobi is a great example of the media transformation taking place due to mobile technology. We support their vision to provide high reach, transparent, performance-based mobile advertising to all corners of the globe,” said Ajit Nazre, Partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &#38; Byers. “InMobi has exceeded our expectations every quarter since the company&#8217;s inception,” said Sandeep Murthy of Sherpalo Ventures. “They’ve not only developed a truly disruptive and leading edge technology, but applied flawless execution to deliver a market changing ad network platform that will achieve new levels in the industry with this funding.” CrunchBase Information InMobi Information provided by CrunchBase </p>

				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Jul 11th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/deals-galore-competitors-abound-a-primer-on-groupon-like-startups.htm#respond" title="Comment on Deals Galore, Competitors Abound: A Primer On Groupon-Like Startups">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> Lately, group-buying sites and other companies that use discount-deals as the core of their business have become a red-hot trend, with Groupon spreading through cities around the world at a frantic pace and countless competitors and clones trying to catch some of the spotlight. Perhaps the reason for the sites’ traction is that the group-buying model is easy to understand. For those that haven&#8217;t tried them, companies like Groupon find local restaurants, spas, or other businesses that are willing to provide large discounts, provided that their name is spread to a number of new customers. Groupon advertises the business by offering the coupons online, and takes a cut of the money spent on them. However, there are plenty of variations on the model and the differences can be confusing, so we’re going to give a primer on some of them below (note that there are plenty of similar companies abroad — these are some of the big names in the US, though some of the companies below are international too). Groupon Groupon is the market leader in the online “group buying” industry, and according to Crunchbase Groupon has raised a whopping $172.8M in funding to date. Available in 140 cities world wide, Groupon offers deals in more cities than any other group buying company. For every city, every day, Groupon presents a discount for a niche market item (such as a spa, restaurant, or a paintball outing), and if enough people sign up for the deal, they get the discount. The coupons are sent to the buyers by email.  Conversely, if the quota is not reached, the deal is off, and no one is charged for what they promised to buy. Of course, if the deal doesn’t work out, the company that Groupon was “advertising” through the discounts, and the people who signed up to buy them will be a little bummed. Because the success of each deal relies on getting enough people to sign up, Groupon has created some incentives for their users to spread the word about the discounts they offer. Groupon encourages its customers to share news about deals through email, Facebook, and Twitter, and promises that if one of their users sends a Groupon link to a friend, and the friend buys a Groupon (coupon) within 72 hours, the one who sent the link gets $10 worth of Groupon credits in their account. Also, if a user sends a referral to a friend, who then subscribes within 72 hours, the person who sent the referral will get $10 worth of Groupon credits in their account when their friend buys their first deal on Groupon. LivingSocial LivingSocial is Groupon’s main competitor, and they serve in 26 cities across the U.S. and have received about $44M in funding. LivingSocial’s model is somewhat different from Groupon’s, as there is no minimum number of people needed to make the deal valid. But like Groupon, the discount can only be activated, and then used, after the deal’s run-time has ended. LivingSocial offers each deal for exactly 24 hours on weekdays, from 5am-5pm. Additionally, LivingSocial uses a different incentive to encourage more people to sign up for their deals. If a LivingSocial user shares a deal through a link provided by LivingSocial, and then three people join the deal through the link, then the person who shared the link gets their deal for free. Gilt City Gilt City, which was recently created as a subunit of Gilt, is only available in New York City so far. Unlike many of its competitors, each of Gilt City’s deals lasts for seven days, and are updated once a week, rather than once a day. Also, rather than trying to sell as many of their deals as possible, Gilt City’s inventory for each of the discounts appears to be limited, and can become sold out, much like the rest of the sales on Gilt. Like LivingSocial, Gilt does not require a minimum number of people to sign up for the deals to make them valid. BuyWithMe BuyWithMe has essentially the same setup as Groupon, with a new deal on display each day, with each the time limit for each deal set for about a week. Though they bring up a new deal each day on their main page, they do run a number of deals in each city (the number of deals running varies from city to city). BuyWithMe operates in 5 cities in the U.S, and has so far received $21.5M in funding. Tippr Tippr is another group-buying site, and offers deals in 25 major U.S. cities. Tippr is owned by Kashless, which has raised  $5 M since starting up. Unlike Groupon, LivingSocial, and BuyWithMe, Tippr proudly shows off three deals each day on their main site, with at least one new deal each day. As an incentive to get more people to join the deal, the discounts that Tippr offers get larger for everyone who signs up, as more people sign up for the deal, though there is a limit to how much the discount increases. A somewhat unusual aspect of Tippr is its army of ten patents, which are kept quietly on display at the bottom of the website (though it isn&#8217;t clear that these will actually help them beat the competition). Juice in the City (JITC) Juice in the City is a niche group-buying site that caters to mothers. This aspect of JITC is what differentiates it from the other companies in this roundup, as each deal that is offered on the site is meant to appeal to women with young children. JITC so far only serves a single deal each day within the San Francisco Bay Area and the Seattle-Tacoma area, and has not yet received any outside funding. They promise incredible, money-saving deals like the rest, but JITC does not require a certain number of people to sign up for each deal. Each coupon is sent to the buyer via email after being purchased, though they can&#8217;t be used the day they were purchased. We Give to Get (WGTG) We Give to Get is available only in Chicago, and offers a new coupon (which they call a GO-GO) each day. What makes WGTG special, is that when you create an account on WGTG, you are also signed up automatically for the charity website; www.actofgood.org . As a result, whenever you buy a GO-GO, 10% of the money that is spent on the coupon will be donated to a charity of your choice, as long as it is listed on www.actofgood.org. It seems like an unusual idea to connect a money-saving action to a money-giving one, but as they say, “opposites attract”. Similarly to Juice in the City and LivingSocial, WGTG does not require a minimum number of people to sign up in order to make the deal valid, and the coupon is sent to the buyer by email after the purchase is made.

				<div class="l"><span class="tim">Jul 10th, 2010</span><span class="com"><a href="http://www.nicetrends.com/people/google-secretly-invested-100-million-in-zynga-preparing-to-launch-google-games.htm#respond" title="Comment on Google Secretly Invested $100+ Million In Zynga, Preparing To Launch Google Games">No Comments</a></span></div>
				<p> Google has quietly (secretly, one might say) invested somewhere between $100 million and $200 million in social gaming behemoth Zynga , we&#8217;ve confirmed from multiple sources. The company has raised somewhere around half a billion dollars in venture capital in the last year alone, including $150 million from Softbank Capital last month and $180 million late last year from Digital Sky Technologies, Tiger Global, Institutional Venture Partners and Andreessen Horowitz. The Softbank announcement was never officially confirmed by the company, however, and the Google investment was likely part of that deal as well. The investment part of the deal closed a month ago or so. A larger strategic partnership is still in process. The investment was made by Google itself, not Google Ventures, say our sources, and it&#8217;s a highly strategic deal. Zynga will be the cornerstone of a new Google Games to launch later this year, say multiple sources. Not only will Zynga&#8217;s games give Google Games a solid base of social games to build on, but it will also give Google the beginning of a true social graph as users log into Google to play the games. And I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see PayPal being replaced with Google Checkout as the primary payment option. Zynga is supposedly PayPal&#8217;s biggest single customer, and Google is always looking for ways to make Google Checkout relevant. And there&#8217;s more. These same sources are saying that Zynga&#8217;s revenues for the first half of 2010 will be a stunning $350 million, half of which is operating profit. Zynga is projecting at least $1.0 billion in revenue in 2011, say our sources. This blows previous estimates out of the water. Zynga continues to work on high level strategic business development deals. The reason these deals are so attractive to companies like Yahoo and now Google is this &#8211; Zynga allows them to rebuild the massive social graph, currently controlled by Facebook. For whatever reason people love to play these games and get passionately addicted to them, coming back day after day. That&#8217;s helped Facebook become what it is today. Google, Yahoo and others want some of that magic to rub off on them, too. We&#8217;ve reached out to both Google and Zynga for comment. Neither have responded. There will be lots more news on Google Games in the near future, we&#8217;re guessing. Here&#8217;s a job opening for a Product Lead for Google Games, for example: Product Management Leader, Games &#8211; Mountain View This position is based in Mountain View, CA. The area: Product Management One of the many reasons Google consistently brings innovative, world-changing products to market is because of the collaborative work we do in Product Management.

We&#8217;re responsible for guiding products throughout the execution cycle, focusing specifically on analyzing, positioning, packaging, promoting and tailoring our solutions to all the markets where Google does business. The role: Product Management Leader, Games The Product Management Leader, Games will be a flexible, results-oriented, and experienced senior leader who will be responsible for developing Google&#8217;s games commerce product strategy and partnering to build and manage the business with a cross-functional team.

The Product Management Leader, Games combines a great instinct for developing compelling products with a strong focus on users and technical aptitude to work with a world class engineering team and the business sense to drive product goals and strategies.

The founders cobbled together the first draft of the site in roughly one month, with a few goals in mind: create a sleek design that does not distract from the person&#8217;s story and offer the product for free. The founders say 1000Memories will always be free and sans advertising, but they plan to roll out optional products for purchase soon, like framed photographs and memory books. Huneycutt also responded to commenters from Arrington&#8217;s post, who wondered what would happen to the content if the business went belly-up: &#8220;I think if someone takes the time to create a memorial site for their loved one, they want to make sure that their photos and their memories are there forever, so along those lines we are making a personal pledge never to erase anyone&#8217;s data or content&#8230; if things do go wrong, we will never erase it and we&#8217;ll make sure to get people their data back.&#8221; CrunchBase Information 1000Memories Information provided by CrunchBase </p>

				<p> &#62; A loved one dies. You get things under control by notifying family and friends, working with a funeral home for the physical remains, and generally getting everything done that needs to get done. You may even get the obituary taken care of for the newspaper, if you still have a local newspaper. But one thing that our culture hasn&#8217;t really figured out yet is how to celebrate a past life online. At some point soon we&#8217;ll start having an awful lot of dead people around. I&#8217;m very sure Google and other search engines will start to filter for deceased people search. It won&#8217;t be long at at until we have way more dead people online than live people online. Legacy.com has partnerships with newspapers to turn obituaries into online sites to commemorate the deceased, but they are more than a little cheesy in their cash extraction procedures. Other services like venture backed Respectance is less aggressive about getting money out of loved ones, but the site design is very dated and there&#8217;s still that leave-a-bad-taste-in-your-mouth feeling. 1000Memories launches today, a new service funded by Y Combinator that is trying to bring some dignity to the deceased online. There&#8217;s a big focus on design at 1000Memories. Here&#8217;s an example site , the great uncle of one of the founders. Visitors are first presented with a big picture of the deceased, presumably that one image that best captured his soul and personality. From there it&#8217;s easy to navigate to your next step as a reader, and sign a guest book. You can also invite others to the page at that time. But what makes each site really rich are the stories and pictures that loved ones add to the site. Some are silly. Others rip tears from your eyes. But it helps fill out the picture of a man, and it helps family and friends remember that man more richly. There&#8217;s also an area for projects &#8211; simple things like lighting candles for the deceased to setting up memorial funds for various causes. Best of all the company isn&#8217;t going to charge for the sites &#8211; they just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the right way. They&#8217;ll develop their business model over time, perhaps creating print books of the content that is left for an individual and letting people buy these books. They don&#8217;t need to make much per site, and it really doesn&#8217;t cost that much to keep these sites live in perpetuity. I wonder if, in a hundred and fifty or so years when I finally shuffle off this mortal coil, where I&#8217;ll end up being memorialized online. I hope it&#8217;s somewhere calm and serene like 1000Memories, and not somewhere that is just trying to gouge cash out of my family. I like this project, I hope it succeeds.
