<P>
<li> <strong>Overview.</strong>  I do research in <A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/">computational
linguistics</A>, with interests both in the modeling of human
linguistic processes (especially lexical semantics, lexical
acquisition, and on-line sentence processing) and in the application of
natural language processing techniques to practical problems such as
machine translation and sentiment analysis.
My general research agenda for language technology
is to improve the state of the art by finding the right balance
between knowledge-free statistical modeling and linguistically
informed techniques -- and in so doing, to obtain a better scientific
understanding of human language itself.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT size="-1">
<strong>Machine translation.</strong> 
My recent work has largely been focused on machine translation and
multilingual natural language processing, exploiting
<A HREF="parallel/">parallel corpora</A> and linguistically informed
modeling in statistical machine translation and in multilingual
natural language processing more generally (with a focus on Chinese
and Arabic, as well as other less-studied languages).  As part of this
effort, my postdoc <A HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~dchiang/">David
Chiang</A> (now at USC/ISI) developed
<A
HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~dchiang/papers/chiang-acl05.pdf">Hiero</A>,
the first syntax-based system to demonstrate performance comparable to
then state-of-the-art statistical phrase-based MT systems (see <A
HREF="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/mt05eval_official_results_release_20050801_v3.html">2005
NIST MT Evaluation results</A>).  I have worked with a number of
students to further improve hierarchical phrase-based translation, and
some innovations include the introduction of lattice
decoding (useful in translation of speech recognition output and also
for text translation of morphologically complex languages),
development of efficient algorithms for using suffix array
representations in hierarchical decoding, use of
English-to-English translation to create artificial reference
translations for use in parameter tuning, the introduction of soft syntactic 
constraints based on source language structure, and exploitation of 
lattices (and soon, forests) to represent source language paraphrase and
syntactically driven reordering alternatives.
<P>
<strong>Crowdsourcing and translation.</strong> 
Connected with my machine translation research, <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~bederson/">Ben Bederson</A> and I 
are working on an ambitious attempt to achieve low cost, high quality translation by taking advantage of 
<em>monolingual</em> human participants in a computer-assisted translation protocol, in a project we call
"Translation as a Collaborative Process".  We're blending ideas from machine translation, human computer-interfaces, and
distributed human computation ("crowdsourcing"), and tackling the real-world problem of translating books
in the <A HREF="http://en.childrenslibrary.org">International Children's Digital Library</A>.  We received a
2009 <A HREF="http://research.google.com/university/relations/research_awards.html">Google Research Award</A> sponsoring
this work, as well as funding from NSF.  In September 2009, Ben gave a <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMj1PnrZphg">
Google tech talk</A> about the project which is available on <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMj1PnrZphg">YouTube</A>.
<P>
<strong>Computational social science.</strong>
I have also been doing work on sentiment analysis and related topics such as persuasion, framing, and "spin",
with a particular interest in the connections among lexical semantics,
surface linguistic expression, and underlying internal state.  For
example, why does my son say "My toy broke" instead of "I broke my
toy"?  He's using syntax to package up the statement about what happened
in a way that de-emphasizes semantic properties such as causation, volition,
and change-of-state.  (This is an example of using syntax for
"spin", just the same way that Ronald Reagan
did in 1987 when he sidestepped attributing responsibility for the
Iran-contra scandal; remember "Mistakes were made"?  Precocious child.)  My student <A
href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/">Stephan Greene</A>
did <A
HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/SGreeneDissertationFinalDist.pdf">a
fascinating dissertation</A> on this topic, and 
for a conference-paper-length description see 
our <A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N09/N09-1057.pdf">2009 NAACL paper</A>.
Current topics of investigation
include modeling syntax/semantics/sentiment connections in a Bayesian framework,
bootstrapping multilingual sentiment analysis capabilities, and working with
social psychologists to look at how language use connects with a
range of psychological and socio-cultural variables.
<P>

<strong>Clinical informatics.</strong> Since about 1999 I've been involved in natural language
processing for clinical documentation. I helped start up <A
HREF="http://www.coderyte.com/">CodeRyte, Inc.</A>, 
which is now the nation's fastest growing provider of NLP solutions in healthcare (see, e.g.,
 <A HREF="http://www.deloitte.com/us/fast500/">Deloitte's Technology Fast 500</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.inc.com/inc5000/profile/coderyte">Inc. 5000</A> listings.)
I developed pieces
of the core technology, helped build an excellent language technology
team, and I currently advise the company on technology development 
and strategic direction.  

I've also presented a tutorial on NLP and computer assisted coding at the
convention of the <A HREF="http://ahima.org">American Health
Information Management Association (AHIMA)</A> and I am one of the
co-chairs of AHIMA's steering committee on computer assisted coding.
Much to my surprise, I was listed at #82 on the <A
HREF="http://healthspottr.com/fh100">Future Health 100</A>, a list of
"the most creative and influential innovators working in healthcare today"
at <A HREF="http://healthspottr.com">healthspottr.com</A>.
<P>


<!--
Continued interests in multilingual NLP include using parallel
bilingual text to improve
<A HREF="http://www.senseval.org/">word sense disambiguation</A> (that
is, the identification of appropriate word meanings in context),
exploiting linguistic information to improve word-to-word alignments
between translations, and developing parsers for resource-poor
languages by projecting linguistic information from English, using a
parallel corpus as a bridge from one language to the other.  
<P>
-->
<P>
<strong>Computational psycholinguistics.</strong>
During the next several years, I hope to re-engage more fully with my
interests in computational psycholinguistics.  I'm particularly
interested in the possibility that ideas from (statistical)
information theory may have a useful role to play in explaining why
language works the way it does.  (This is an idea I first began
exploring in my dissertation [<A HREF="pubs/resnik_dissertation.ps">ps</A>,
<A HREF="pubs/resnik_dissertation.pdf">pdf</A>], back in 1993, and in recent years a variety
of people like John Hale, Roger Levy, and Florian Jaeger, among others, have done very 
interesting work in the same spirit.)  I'm also trying to use
Bayesian modeling as a way to bring linguists here with cognitive modeling 
interests together with computational linguists focusing on applications.
<P>
<strong>Empirical linguistics.</strong>
I'm quite interested in promoting the use of naturally occurring data as evidence
in linguistics research. , I led the development of the <A
HREF="http://lse.umiacs.umd.edu/">Linguist's Search Engine</A>, a tool
designed to make it easier for linguists to search naturally occurring
data using syntactic and lexical criteria.  This tool was intended to
make it easier for more linguists to go beyond the exclusive use of
introspective judgments as empirical evidence, <A
HREF="pubs/bls2005.pdf">which can lead to useful and interesting
results</A>.  In follow-on work with the <A
HREF="http://www.casl.umd.edu/">Center for the Advanced Study of
Language (CASL)</A>, we ported the LSE to Chinese, and the LSE code is
available under an open source license.  (<A
HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~aelkiss">Aaron Elkiss</A> was the LSE's
chief architect, implementor, and guru.  I kept it running for a number of years
after he graduated, but eventually retired it.  Anyone interested in 
resurrecting it: the source code is available.)

<H2>The Rest</H2>

<UL> 

<LI> First on the list of important things in my life would have to be
my family: Ben (here's a <A HREF="ben/">home page</A> he created many years ago,
preserved for sentimental reasons), my incredibly
wonderful wife, <A
HREF="http://www.mindwellpsychology.com/rebecca.html">Becky</A>, and our sons
Harry and Jay.
And let's not forget <A HREF="annie">Annie the Dog</A>.
<P>

<LI> I am, believe it or not (sometimes I don't), a Sunday school
music teacher, at
<A HREF="http://www.bethchai.org/">Beth Chai</A>, the The Greater
Washington Jewish Humanist Congregation.  Beth Chai is a lovely
community of people from all over the D.C. area, and it's really
growing.
<P>

<LI> During a wonderful several years of exercising consistently, I worked my way up to an advanced brown belt in Thai Kickboxing.
(Just in case the Sunday School approach doesn't solve all my
problems, you know? :->) I learned many <A
HREF="http://www.bbmac.com/ADOBE%20DOCS/How%20to%20tie%20your%20belt.pdf">challenging
moves</A>.  I got back to it after a several year hiatus, and then managed to tear my medial meniscus 
As of this writing, I am several weeks post-surgery and I have progressed beyond "geriatric shuffle" and 
"hobble" to "proper limp".  I'm itching to get back to the kickboxing as soon as my knee (and my surgeon) let me.
<P>

<LI> In 2000 I became a homeowner.  Eeek!  Then in 2006 we moved to a new house (and spent quite a while
trying to sell the old one, sigh, though it ended happily).  To get an idea what the joys of
home ownership are like, take a look at my 
<A HREF="contractors.html">Home Problem Solving</A> page.
<P>

<LI> Other goings on... I've been interested in swing and ballroom
dance since taking some <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu/bdclub/">classes at
MIT</A> and even, once upon a time, competing at the <OLD_IGNORE
HREF="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~hrbdc/announce/comp96.html"> Fifth
Annual Harvard Ballroom Dance Team Invitational
Competition</OLD_IGNORE>.  (Newcomer category, made the quarter finals
in East coast swing and managed not to embarass either my partner or
myself at tango and foxtrot.)  Here's a somewhat
personalized <A HREF="dancing.html">list of useful dancing sites</A>
in the D.C. area created before Harry and Jay were born, when
having a handy list of dancing sites was connected with actually going
out dancing.  That's another thing I'm hoping we'll get back to before
too long...
<P>
<LI> I came across an old dance acquaintance on the Web,
helping illustrate <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20040202000531/http://dancestore.com/anna/anna.html">why I like lindyhop</A>.  :-)
<P>
<!-- <LI> I occasionally (these days <em>very</em> occasionally) play in
the semi-regular, never predictable linguistics department soccer
game.  Check out the photographic record of one of our
<A HREF="http://www.ling.umd.edu/PhotoAlbum/">
profs-versus-students games</A>.  In the 
<A HREF="http://www.ling.umd.edu/PhotoAlbum/pages/DSCN0599.htm">
group photo</A> that's me behind the guy in the blue shirt, and that's
Ben getting smooshed by the guy in the blue shirt.  (Believe me, he
deserved it.) <P> -->

<LI> In 1996 I sang at the 50th anniversary concert of the
<A HREF="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~kroks">Harvard Krokodiloes</A>, a
12-man <i>a capella</i> singing group of which I am an alumnus.  
In the blink of an eye, the 60th anniversary rolled around and I sang in 
one of the alumni performances for that event, too.
<P>

<LI> A while back I took a rather interesting trip to New Orleans for
Mardi Gras, and wrote up <A HREF="new_orleans.html">some of my
adventures</A>.
<P>

<LI> Check out <A HREF="http://www.echelman.com/"> artist Janet
Echelman's Web page</A>. I'm pleased to have helped put together her
original page, years ago in the dark ages when Janet was a Web novice.
She's now obviously surpassed my meager Web talents by a long shot.<P>

<LI> I just stumbled across a bit of <A
  HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=QLSndQ8AAAC9xIizuDKKpmRL56tSppdr">ancient
  history</A>.    Pretty fun to be able to document my Internet presence back to 1989.
<P>

<LI> Quite some time back, I added a bullet recommending that people
check out <A
HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/annies_census_song.html">Annie's
Census Song</A>, a trifle of satire written by a dear friend, author
and screenwriter <A HREF="http://www.nicolegalland.com">Nicki
Galland</A>, in a mad fit of boredom.  I wrote, "Nicki is much busier
these days, having published a well received first novel entitled <A
HREF="http://www.nicolegalland.com/synopsis_ft.htm">The Fool's
Tale</A>; then a second novel (<A
HREF="http://www.nicolegalland.com/synopsis_rr.htm">Revenge of the
Rose</A>, which came out in August 2006).  Her third novel is, I
believe, due out in early 2008."  Well, that novel came out --- <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Crossed-Fourth-Crusade-Nicole-Galland/dp/006084180X">Crossed:
A Tale of the Fourth Crusade</A> --- and although it's great
historical fiction on its own, you should check out <A
HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWZhtT5b3PM">this YouTube
promo</A> for a fascinating take on how the book only <em>seems</em>
to be about the fourth crusade but is, in a deeper sense, really about
what's been going on in Iraq.
<P>

<LI> Photo for a neat <A HREF="akimitsu.jpg">science fair project</A> for which
  I helped provide a few pointers.  (How many 7th graders do you know
  who are looking into information theory?!)
<P>

<LI>Once upon a time, Ben invented <A HREF="scimon">Scimon Cards</A>, which 
are like Pokemon cards but for science-minded kids.  
<P>
<LI>  A few favorite books, ones that I revisit every few years once
      they are "ripe" for re-reading...<P>
 <ul>
 <li>  Mark Helprin, <em>Winter's Tale</em>
 <li>  Peter S. Beagle, <em>A Fine and Private Place</em>
 <li>  Orson Scott Card, <em>Ender's Game</em>
 <li>  William Goldman, <em>The Princess Bride</em>
 <li>  Frances Hodgson Burnett, <em>The Lost Prince</em>
 <li>  Margaret Atwood, <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>  (Are we there yet?)
 <li>  Neal Stephenson, <em>Cryptonomicon</em>
 <li>  Lawrence Block, <em>The Triumph of Evil</em> (a little known gem)
