    <p>Stacy Vanderworth</p><p>1. Mason and Suri outline how to conduct behavioral research on Mechanical Turk, in excruciating detail.</p><p>2. This paper is an extremely thorough guide, tackling both the high-level issues and more pragmatic technical aspects of performing behavioral research on Mechanical Turk.</p><p>3. Not being a behavioral researcher looking to create some HITs, I found this to be a very dry and tedious read, and I think it covers more ground in the technical aspects of mturk than is needed.</p><p>4. I learned that it is possible to perform synchronous experiments using an online "waiting room"-- a possibility that I had not previously considered.</p><p>5. It seems odd to me that varying the size of the incentives (after it has surpassed that "reservation wage") doesn't significantly affect responses.</p><p>6. I am definitely interested in the psychology of why wage doesn't matter past a certain point.</p>

    <p>Adriana K.</p><p>1. This paper describes how to use Mechanical Turk for behavioral research, including conceptual issues (e.g. what type of studies MTurk can accommodate or how to ensure quality of the work) and technical issues (e.g. how to use the MTurk API and command line tools).</p><p>2. The biggest strength of this paper was that it presented in great detail, and in a nicely organized fashion, the specifics of using one particular form of crowdsourcing, and so if one has not already used MTurk, they can use it as a guide rather than having to figure out the details of the API on their own.</p><p>3. The main weakness of this paper is that it tries to cover perhaps too much ground, which makes it seem like it lacks focus-- there is a mixture of references to other studies, reports of the authors' own experiences and implementation ideas, and at the same time a tutorial on MTurk, which could have been split into two or three papers and covered in more depth.</p><p>4. I learned that MTurk offers payment in US dollars and Indian rupees, which probably explains why the workers are mostly from the US and India.</p><p>5. I did not understand whether or not the amount of payment actually affects the quantity of completed work-- the sentence at the top of the right column on page 8 seems ambiguous.</p><p>6. I would like to learn more about the design of synchronous experiments, particularly the technical details and also how to generalize the given scenario for other real-life-like experiments.</p>

    <p>Stephen M. Wolfson</p><p>1. This article argues that researchers could benefit greatly from suing Amazon Mechanical Turk as a tool for behavioral research, writing their paper to two populations: 1. researchers who are unaware of Mechnical Turk; and 2. researchers who may be aware of Mechanical Turk but who do not know its capabilities.</p><p>2. I think this paper provides a pretty good introduction to conducting work on Mechanical Turk, especially for the complete beginner because it clearly lays out some of the basic reasons to conduct research on this platform.</p><p>3. One weakness of this article, to me, is that I was not completely convicted their ideas for developing a synchronous study would actually work very well when put in practice. While I understood it it seems this research model would be much better suited for an off line, “real life” study.</p><p>4. One thing I learned from this article, and plan to follow up on, is that the author Felstiner, apparently addresses several of the ethical legal issues that crowdsourcing raises which I think this will be an interesting and potentially very important read because these ethical issues strike me as very important.</p><p>5. From the section discussing security, I did not know what a database injection attack was or what the authors mean by “scrubbing user input for database commands.”</p><p>6. I plan to read more about how people have considered the legal issues behind conducting any research, including behavioral research, on Mechanical Turk.</p>

    <p>Karen Kremer</p><p>1.Mason and Suri’s article covers the main advantages, disadvantages, theories and methods in which Amazon’s Mechanical Turk can be used for behavioral research.</p><p>2. This paper could be an extremely useful guide for someone who actually wants to use Mechanical Turk to conduct a behavioral research study: in the third part of the paper, Mason and Suri delve into technical issues and provide detailed instructions for using Mechanical Turk.</p><p>3. While this turn would provide useful for those engineering behavioral research studies on MTurk, it may be off-putting to those that are more interested in the implications and theories than actually creating a research study on MTurk (however, the writers do state that these people could easily skip the last section).</p><p>4. I was surprised to learn that 27% of Indian workers describe Mechanical Turk as their main source of income (and that the authors included this data in the paper).</p><p>5. On the other hand, I do not understand why people (about 10% of American workers) use Mechanical Turk to do tasks when they consider the money earned to be irrelevant – I wish the authors would have gone into a little more detail on this subject.</p><p>6. I am interested in looking more into the ethical issues behind low wages on Mechanical Turk and curious if the money earned may go farther in poorer countries.</p>

    <p>[Katya_Lyka]</p><p>1. The paper discusses extensively how the researchers/requesters can use Mechanical Turk to conduct their research. It talks in detail how HIT’s can be created and submitted for the workers on Mechanical Turk.</p><p>2. The biggest strength of the paper is the detail with which the authors discuss how to create HIT’s to ensure the quality of the work and the data submitted. It talks about the creating HIT’s in ways which can be useful to the requestors like how they can conduct synchronous experiments and ensure random assignments. It also touches upon various other concerns with crowdsourcing like ethical issues, compensation and security.</p><p>3. It seems like a step-by-step guide to Mechanical Turk. For someone who has worked on Mechanical Turk before this can seem to be irrelevant detail.</p><p>4. I learnt that the HIT’s can be created internally and externally on the Mechanical Turk. It gave me an insight into creating HIT’s and how requestors on Mechanical Turk actually go about creating the tasks that we perform.</p><p>5. I did not quite follow a few of the detailed description of creating HIT’s I felt it required a little more knowledge of HTML terminology than I have.</p><p>6. After reading the paper I would like to create an HIT myself, this way I can put theory to practice and learn better and maybe can find out other ways to create HIT’s to tackle the problem of spammers</p>
