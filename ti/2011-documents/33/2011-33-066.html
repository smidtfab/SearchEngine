<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Jeff Klingner</strong><br />Jeff is a computer scientist and consultant for HRDAG. He earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stanford University, where he received a National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship. Dr. Klingner has collaborated with HRDAG since 2005. He performed data analysis and created visualizations of document flow within the Chadian government in the 1980s, establishing that the president of Chad was in control of the country's secret police and was well-informed of hundreds of deaths that occurred in police prisons. He implemented data-cleaning and conducted analysis of several sources of data collected by Ensaaf in Punjab, India, establishing verifiable quantitative findings on mass disappearances and extrajudicial executions during the Sikh uprising and resultant police and army crackdown of 1984-1995. Dr. Klingner designed and wrote a machine-learning software package for de-duplicating and merging lists of violent deaths and other human rights violations. HRDAG has applied this technology to many analyses, including its work in Colombia, El Salvador, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Dr. Klingner's contributions to HRDAG also include data mining, visualization, survey estimation, inter-rater reliability analysis and a multiple systems estimation simulation package.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Tom Mitchell</strong><br />Tom is the E. Fredkin University Professor and head of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a Fellow and Past President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Mitchell's research involves developing statistical machine learning algorithms, motivated by particular applications. One current application focus is cognitive neuroscience. In particular, Mitchell has been using fMRI and MEG brain image data to study how the human brain uses neural activity to represent meanings of common words. One of the attached papers describes the use of machine learning algorithms to develop a computational model that predicts the observed fMRI neural activity observed for specific nouns. A second current application area involves analysis of large volumes of text to extract targetted information. In particular, Mitchell leads the "Read the Web" research project which uses machine learning methods to extract hundreds of types of targetted information from the web, such as information about which cities lie on which rivers, the names of different regions in the brain, and which companies compete with one another. This research has produced a growing knowledge base containing hundreds of thousands of such beliefs.
