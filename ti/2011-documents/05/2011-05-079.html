<h1>Alex Rudnick: CV</h1>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Natural language processing and machine learning. Machine translation.
Education and using human language technology to expand access to the world's
information.</p>

<h2>Current research</h2>
<p>
With Michael Gasser's HLTDI group, building a machine translation system for
resource-scarce languages, such as Quechua and Amharic, using synchronous
dependency grammars. As of 2011, working on a related systems for learning the
arguments for verbs in an unfamiliar language, and acquiring grammars via
active learning. Goals for the future include integrating defeasible
constraints into our system, optimizing weights, and building training corpora
by crowdsourcing.
</p>

<h2>Professional experience</h2>

<h3>Software Engineering Intern: Google</h3>
<p>
<i>New York City, May 2010 to August 2010.</i> Worked with the Speech team at
Google Research. Parallelized code to build finite-state transducers, using
MapReduce in C++. Made small patches to OpenFST. Investigated integrating
models of phoneme durations with the current weighted-FST based software.
</p>

<h3>Software Engineer: Google</h3>
<p>
<i>Atlanta, July 2007 to July 2009.</i> Worked as a software engineer in
Google's Atlanta office with the Google Web Toolkit team. Focused on user
interface components, internationalization and accessibility features. Built a
new online documentation browser, which was used for the GWT 1.5 documentation,
and can optionally be used with any project hosted on Google Code. Helped build
and launch the Google Plugin for Eclipse, extensions for the popular Eclipse
IDE which make it easier for Java developers to use GWT and Google App Engine.
Maintained documentation, answered questions from the community, and built
helpful samples in Java and Scala.

<h2>Teaching</h2>

<h3>B651: Natural Language Processing, Indiana University</h3>
<p>
<i>Fall 2010.</i>
Helped teach Michael Gasser's introductory NLP course; constructed some new
homework assignments, introducing some of the ideas behind automatic speech
recognition and grammar learning. Did a bunch of grading.
</p>

<h3>C211: Introduction to Computer Science, Indiana University</h3>
<p>
<i>Fall 2009, Spring 2010, Spring 2011.</i>
Gave weekly discussions, lab sections, and well-attended office hours for an
introductory CS class in Scheme. Wrote class-infrastructure software, including
a web application to assign lab partners and a system to manage student
programming contests.
</p>

<h3>Institute for Computing Education, Georgia Tech.</h3>
<p>
<i>Summer 2005, 2006, 2007.</i>
Media Computation summer camp at Georgia Tech. Taught high- and middle-school
students media concepts and basic programming with Python, Alice, and Scratch.
Played frisbee and went on scavenger hunts around the campus. For Summer 2006,
helped teach Media Computation workshops for high school computer science
teachers.
</p>

<h3>CS2130: Languages and Translation, Georgia Tech </h3>
<p>
<i>Spring 2003, Fall 2003, Spring 2004.</i>
TA for Georgia Tech's CS2130 "Languages and Translation", which covered C
programming and basic compilers. Wrote new assignments and automatic grading
programs, including an auto-grader that could distinguish non-recursive,
recursive, and tail-recursive solutions. Taught weekly recitations and review
sessions.
</p>

<h2>Earlier research experience</h2>

<h3>Contextual Computing Group</h3>
<p>
<i>Fall 2006 - Summer 2007.</i>
For Thad Starner's Contextual Computing Group, developed classifiers for
finding typographical errors made on mobile QWERTY keyboards, particularly
accidentally repeated keystrokes and near-misses. The classifiers take into
account letter frequencies, n-gram frequencies, keypress timing information,
and keyboard layout.
</p>

<h3>Contextualized Support for Learning lab</h3>
<p>
<i>Fall 2006 - Spring 2007.</i>
With Mark Guzdial, helped develop JES, the Jython Environment for Students.
Added functionality for LOGO-style turtles and animations, improved speed,
usability, maintainability of code and documentation. Occasionally filled in
giving lectures for Dr. Guzdial's CS 1 and 2 classes.
</p>

<h3>Adaptive Personal Information Environments group</h3>
<p>
<i>Spring 2006 - Spring 2007.</i>
Worked on SWIMM, a music-player that uses machine learning to model the
listener's preferences and play songs in an appropriate order, based on signal
features extracted from the songs and their ID3 metadata. Updated the interface
and functionality to convert between sound formats, helped clean up existing
code.
</p>

<h3>Learning By Design group</h3>
<p>
<i>Summer 2005 - Spring 2006.</i>
Built web applications for Janet Kolodner's Kitchen Science Investigators
project, a study on teaching children science concepts through cooking. This
included software to help children easily upload images from digital cameras
and manage their online lab notebooks.
</p>

<h3>Electronic Learning Communities group</h3>
<p>
<i>Fall 2001 - Fall 2002.</i>
Worked on Amy Bruckman's MOOSE Crossing, a text-based online world for teaching
children programming concepts. Helped develop the world, the server code, and
the related curriculum. Spoke to the community, often in person; made weekly
visits to local after-school Computer Clubhouses.
</p>

<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
<p>
Distance running (marathons), juggling, and cycling. Playing the drums. Reading
philosophy, history, linguistics, popular science, and a lot of news.
