			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My crowdsourcing radar used to consist of Google Alerts and
a RSS feed from Technorati. Then I installed TweetDeck on my laptop. I&#39;m not sure if it was the best or the worst thing I&#39;ve
ever done. I had thought of Twitter as a broadcast tool, but it&#39;s become far more valuable to me as a listening device. I used to say that keeping track of crowdsourcing&#39;s growth was a full-time job (the punchline being that I already have a a few full-time jobs).&#0160; Now it would take an entire newsroom (okay, a small one) to cover the diverse, imaginative—and occasionally <a href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b105808_sorry_nasa_colbert_conquers_final.html">wrong-headed</a>—ways crowdsourcing is manifesting in our culture. Anyway, here were a few of the more significant developments from the week:</p><p><strong>Open for Questions, or Open for Vote Rigging? </strong><br />President Obama held the first <a href="http://personaldemocracy.com/node/7333">crowdsourced press conference</a>. The administration used Google Moderator to collect questions from citizens, and vote for those already posed. Results were decidedly mixed. The marijuana lobby turned out in force, effectively stuffing the ballot box for decriminalization topics. My colleage Nick Thompson has done my work for me <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/will-obama-cave.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/liveblogging-th.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/drug-legalizati.html">here</a>. The long and short of it is that one interest group gamed the system to vote their concerns to the top. As scores of other people have pointed out, decriminalization is a legitimate topic for a press conference, but hardly represents a pressing issue. My read: Open for Questions highlights that the ideastorm model of crowdsourcing is still very much in a beta phase, useful for some applications and counter-productive for others. </p><p><strong>An Index of Crowdsourcing</strong><br />Boy has this been a long time coming. <a href="http://twitter.com/anjali28">Anjali Ramachandran</a>, a strategist at London-based digital agency <a href="http://www.madebymany.co.uk/">Made by Many</a>, posted a <a href="http://crowdsourcingexamples.pbwiki.com/">wiki</a> with 135 companies currently engaging in some form of crowdsourcing. It&#39;s a great start, and Anjali is asking us all to help expand it. Such efforts are crucial to the maturation and understanding of crowdsourcing. The phenomenon has grown so rapidly (and so haphazardly) that it&#39;s exceeded any single person&#39;s capacity to track it. I know there are a lot of crowdsourcing junkies reading this post. I&#39;d encourage you all to go contribute.</p><p><strong>Um, Do You Know How We Can Get Out of This Mess?</strong><br />Ireland&#39;s economy has been especially hard hit by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01ferguson.html">Great Recession</a>. Enter &quot;The Ideas Campaign,&quot; or &quot;the <a href="http://http://www.ideascampaign.ie/">People&#39;s Campaign for Economic Growth</a>,&quot; an open innovation project operated and paid for by Irish Web consulting firm, AMAS. Here&#39;s Springwise: &quot;Launched just a week ago, the Ideas Campaign is asking the citizens of Ireland to propose innovative ideas to boost
economic activity in the country across 19 key areas including
manufacturing, technology, construction, retail and education.&quot; Great idea. Horrible execution. The ideas are collected, vetted and posted back to the site without any opportunity for the community to vote, comment or otherwise interact with them. A perfect use for aforementioned Google Moderator. Would the <a href="http://norml.org/">Dope Lobby</a>—or more to the point, some special interest—have gamed this site like they did President Obama&#39;s? Possibly, but that&#39;s an argument for enhanced moderation, not locking out the crowd&#39;s input on, well, the crowd&#39;s input. If it works for Ireland, maybe <a href="http://forums.intpcentral.com/showthread.php?t=31678&amp;page=3">Iceland</a> will give crowdsourcing a spin.</p><p><strong>Smartsourcing vs. Crowdsourcing</strong><br />Pete Peterson has a <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/government-needs-smart-sourcing-not-crowdsourcing">very thoughtful</a> essay at techPresident this week in which he examined the Obama administration&#39;s mixed results from such crowdsourcing experiments as the <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/wrapping_up_the_citizens_briefing_book/">Citizen&#39;s Briefing Book</a> (another ideajam that was stampeded by the drug lobby). He advocates bringing together &quot;select group of citizens.&quot;</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />The government can serve a vital role as
convener – bringing together smart people from a variety of viewpoints
to collaborate and debate online over particular policy initiatives.
These policy discussions – whether in wiki or blog format – can be kept
transparent and open to the public’s view, but as we have seen during
the Transition, these must be controlled in such a way as to prevent
hijacking by small, organized groups.&quot;<br /></div><p><br />I couldn&#39;t agree more. I would just like to point out that smartsourcing (great term!) <em>is </em>crowdsourcing. In my <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html">original article</a> on crowdsourcing as well as in my talks, I&#39;ve always said, &quot;First—pick the right crowd.&quot; This has theoretical underpinnings. Scott E. Page, who&#39;s probably done more work than anyone in collective intelligence, calls this a &quot;crowd of models.&quot; Diversity will trump ability, he notes, but only if a certain level of talent and ability are mixed in with that diversity. At any rate, Peterson&#39;s post is the read of the week, in my view.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m just rolling in from an open jaw that took me from Austin to Boston and back. (I went to SXSW to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQu0292dftA">moderate</a> a panel and <a href="http://sxsw.com/node/1254">read</a> from my book, then to the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center</a> for a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2009/03/howe">talk</a>. More on these later.) What did I miss? To judge by my tweetdeck alerts, quite a lot. Here are some highlights, in no particular order:</p><p><strong>Crowdsourcing Schadenfreude<br /></strong>A few days after sitting on my SXSW panel the Forrester analyst Jeremiah Owyang published an <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2009/03/16/expect-changes-at-mzinga/">unfortunate post</a> about Mzinga, one of the companies he follows. Within he reported that he&#39;d been hearing rumors of financial difficulties at the company, and advised his clients to &quot;<em><em>stall</em> </em>any additional movement till they brief me next Monday&quot; (italics his). Without recounting the resulting shit storm (Which you can read about <a href="http://copywriteink.blogspot.com/2009/03/ruffling-feathers-jeremiah-owyang.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dooleycommunications.ca/2009/03/17/the-owyang-blunder-the-phallic-typewriter-gets-castrated/">here</a>), I would like to pass censure on the (purported) <a href="http://bigtweet.com/c/b/twitter/tomhumbarger/tQ8XU">use of crowdsourcing</a> to determine whether Forrester should give Owyang the ax. Basically, a social media consultant asked his readers to vote on Owyang&#39;s fate. A) This is only crowdsourcing if Forrester were to base a decision on it (which they surely won&#39;t); B) it gives form to the sort of anonymous trollery that all is social media&#39;s least attractive feature.</p><p><strong>Crowdsourcing Congress<br /></strong>I&#39;ve been ignoring the rise of crowdsourcing in governance for the excellent reason that I&#39;d have to drop my day job in order to due the subject justice. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve been lurking. Guest blogging at O&#39;Reilly, Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose brought Gov 2.0
one step closer to fruition by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/crowdsourcing-evolution-of-congressional-websites.html">asking the crowd</a> how Congressional Websites might best take advantage of, well, crowdsourcing.</p><p><strong>Crowdsourcing Recycling</strong><br />Brilliant, common-sense <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/crowdsourcing_recycling_ideas_12926.asp">use of community</a> to disseminate recession-era home ec.</p><p><strong>Army of ... Many?</strong><br />Tantalizing, right? Tune in later when I actually have time to complete a friggin&#39; blog post. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I landed in London last night. It's been a pretty harrowing few days. My wife left last Thursday for rural Illinois, I dropped our daughter off with friends and then took our one year old and caught up with Alysia in Kewanee, Illinois, hog capital of the world (That last is no idle boast, but a decree passed down by an act of Congress in 1942). We were there for her grandmother's funeral, a very sad affair. She was 91, had been ill for several months, had lived a long, rich life, enjoyed the love and devotion of a large family and many friends and none of that offers us a bit of comfort. We weren't ready for her to go. Perhaps when you really love someone, you never are, I don't know. </p>

<p>Unlike me to get personal on these pages, I know, but &quot;Munca,&quot; aka Ann Binder, was a great old broad and a dear friend and possessed one of the most searching intelligences of anyone I'd ever met. Ah, but I mentioned reviews, didn't I? Good stuff came in over the weekend:</p>

<p><em>Newsweek</em> gives the crowdsourcing book what I might call a qualified <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/158601">rave</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Crowdsourcing may represent a true revolution in how human communities
form and interact, and an early indicator of where the Internet is
leading society. And Howe's book does a better job than anything I've
seen of convincing you of that fact.</p></blockquote><p>The Financial Times also published <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/148dd668-8060-11dd-99a9-000077b07658.html">its review</a> this weekend.&nbsp; It's generally positive, but takes me to task for casting crowdsourcing in a pollyannish light. Here's the critic,&nbsp; James Harkin: </p><blockquote><p>If James Surowiecki was the Karl Marx of the movement, favouring rule
by the many, Howe is its Lenin. Howe is focused on how to turn theory
into lucrative practice. More than Surowiecki, too, he believes the
internet is capable of unleashing the wisdom of the crowd.</p></blockquote><p>I think this misrepresents the book, and it certainly misrepresents my thinking. While I fill the book with case studies, many of them highlight ways in which crowdsourcing fails, and I explicitly caution against companies attempting to use crowdsourcing strictly as a financial strategy. More to the point, I reinforce Surowiecki's caution that without the right conditions collective intelligence fails to emerge, and in fact go into great detail about why this is so, using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Difference-Diversity-Creates-Schools-Societies/dp/0691128383">Scott E. Page</a>'s work as a guide. Luckily, I'll have the chance to bring such differences up with James personally, as he'll be hosting <a href="http://www.ica.org.uk/Crowdsourcing+17653.twl">my book party</a> tomorrow night. </p>

<p>And then finally there's <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/columnists/28360734.html">this</a> from the Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Chris Satullo. Not precisely a review, but it's a nice meditation on the themes in the book, with a few apt citations. </p>

				<p>Sure, crowdsourcing is being used to find a cure for <a href="http://www.prize4life.org/">Lou Gehrig's Disease</a> and <a href="http://kiva.org/">fund small businesses in the developing world</a>, but what has it done to address the far more serious threat of zombification? Nothing until <a href="http://www.lostzombies.com/">now.</a> The living (and the dead) can scoff and laugh all they want, but those of us who have had first-hand brushes with the <em>un</em>dead (or just really wish we'd had) know how long overdue such a project is. As the creators of LostZombies.com note, &quot;motherf***ing zombies are real!&quot; Motherf***ing A, they are—You think an image like <a href="http://www.austinprobe.com/images/zombies-large.jpg">this</a> could be created using Photoshop? Lostzombies is accepting all video, photographic evidence of zombie encounters, which will be stitched together (heh heh) to form a zombie documentary. About time crowdsourcing tackled the big issues. Dig the video call to arms, below:</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Law enforcement agencies were quick to adopt crowdsourcing. In the fall of 2006 Texas <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/11/crowdsourcing_l.php">set up the &quot;Virtual Neighborhood Border Watch Program</a>; One detective <a href="http://zero.newassignment.net/filed/cold_case_investigations_benefit_crowdsourcing">employed crowdsourcing </a>(and playing cards!) to crack cold cases; and late last year the <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071228/145343.shtml">FBI</a> announced a plan to turn 150 digital billboards into massive wanted posters. It's a natural fit, and hardly unprecedented. Think of that standby of old Westerns, the posse or—more ominously—the Stasi's persuading one half of the East German populace to spy on the other half. Crowdsourcing <em>Uber Alles</em>!</p>

<p>Which brings us to our first link of the day: <a href="http://www.ucrime.com/">UCrime</a>, which takes campus crime data and maps it using a GoogleMap API, representing each category of crime with a cute little icon (did anyone ever really put money in a bag with a dollar sign on it?) Sound familiar? That's because <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/">Adrian Holovaty </a>got hella props when he did the same thing with a far larger data set, creating the seminal <a href="http://chicago.everyblock.com/crime/">ChicagoCrime.org</a> (since folded into Holovaty's hyper-local journalism company, <a href="http://www.everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</a>). Ever since programmers and journalists alike have gone dotty over data-feeds. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><em>The UCrime Map of my hometown university, Ohio State.</em></span>

</p>

<p>What separates UCrime from the pack? It's Web 2.0, but squared! Which is to say, UCrime has added a few crowdsourcey features to their service. Not only can students look at a visual representation of crime at their uni, they can use UCrime to <del>trash their enemies</del> report crimes themselves. &quot;Social networking features will,&quot; according to CEO Colin Drane, &quot;empower [them] to provide tips and ideas to help solve crimes and improve public safety.&quot; Wonderful. A tipline with all the credibility of a MySpace page. My cynicism may well be premature: If UCrime can help me find out who stole my mountain bike in 1992, I'll cheerfully grovel out an apology. Hint: I last saw it chained to a meter outside the Ohio University student union. (<em>Thanks to the reliably astute Craig Stoltz at &quot;<a href="http://2ohreally.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/crowdsourcing-crime-ucrimecom/">Web 2.Oh ... Really?&quot; </a>for his post on UCrime.)</em></p>

<p>On to India, where an electric utility in the state of Haryana has <a href="http://www.indiaprwire.com/businessnews/20080805/32507.htm">set up a &quot;theft informer scheme&quot;</a> to deter people from stealing electricity. The program received 8,500 complaints leading to 1,400 &quot;theft incidents,&quot; which one has to imagine is a pretty good signal to noise ratio. After some trial and error, informers now receive 40 percent of the value of the recovered electricty (no word on how that's measured), leading one blogger on the subcontinent to <a href="http://www.pluggd.in/2008/08/haryana-electricity-board-takes-web20-route-goes-for-crowdsourcing">wonder</a> whether crowdsourcing's success is proportional to the size of the incentive. I'd say yes, but caution that the incentive isn't always (or even usually) measured in dollars—or rupees.</p>

<p>Finally, the promised (and not entirely unrelated) miscellany: </p>

<p>• The Knight-Batten Awards for Innovations in Journalism <a href="http://www.j-lab.org/kb08release_aug.shtml">were announced yesterday</a>. Included was <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi,</a> a &quot;grassroots information-sharing&quot; Website where Kenyan &quot;bloggers and citizen journalists could text eyewitness accounts and map incidents of political violence.&quot; We tend to focus on the impact citizen/crowdsourced/distributed journalism will have in the United States, but it holds an even greater promise in regions where journalistic resources are scarce.</p>

<p>• Finally, Mozilla <a href="http://profy.com/2008/08/06/mozilla-outsources-the-future-of-the-internet/">crowdsources</a> the &quot;future of the Internet,&quot; by which they seem to mean, the future of the Internet <em>browser.</em> It seems like a contest without a winner or a prize, which I think is the wrong way to go. (If someone from Mozilla wants to correct me on this, please speak up.) Early submissions can be seen <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mozconcept&amp;w=all">here.</a>&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of the trends I've noticed over the course of this year is that just as the mainstream begins to adopt crowdsourcing, a chorus of critical voices has emerged to question how it's being <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2007/12/21/please-stop-crowdsourcing-me/">practiced,</a> if it accurately describes <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/07/11/whyIDontLikeCrowdSourcing.html">what's really happening on the social Web</a> or simply whether <a href="http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2008/05/13/cambrian-house-failure-or-evolution/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a business model based on crowdsourcing can succeed at all</span></a>. <br /><br />As longtime readers of this blog know, I'm a big fan of such dissenting views. First, they're often—if not always—right. More importantly, the scrutiny makes everyone work smarter and harder. In this vein, I'm dedicating today's round up to the wisdom of the few to mitigate foolishness of the many.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fortiusone.com/about_us.php">FortiusOne</a> makes &quot;the World’s geographic data accessible to everyone for
learning, decision making and problem solving.&quot; (I think this means they collect GIS and release it in the wild, a la open source, though if anyone from the company is reading this, feel free to correct me in the comments). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GIS_software">Open source GIS</a> has an extensive history, and I've long predicted that crowdsourcing map data will eventually be adopted by all Geo-data providers. That's quickly becoming the case, as a <a href="http://changespotting.tomtom.com/">new initiative</a> from GPS data giant <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/about/index.php?Lid=4">TomTom</a> makes clear.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mwU9-yCs28k&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><embed width="425" height="344" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mwU9-yCs28k&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></embed></object>

</p>



<p>But Sean Gorman, the founder of FortiusOne, is hardly pursuing his own crowdsourcing strategy willy nilly. In fact, he's just put up a <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/07/29/ethics-of-crowdsourcing-what-constitutes-an-abuse-of-the-commons/">thoughtful post</a> that asks &quot;what constitutes an abuse of the commons&quot; in the context of crowdsourcing? His concern centers primarily on whether wholesale data downloading will slow the site down for everyone else. I'd call that a technical concern more than an ethical one, but I like the spirit of his inquiry: What impact will all this user-generated data have on everyone else's experience? <em>(Thanks to <a href="http://www.crowdsourcingdirectory.com/">Crowdsourcing Directory</a> for the tip on TomTom.)</em></p>

<p><strong>When Good Crowdsourcing Goes Bad</strong></p>

<p>IMDB.com generally makes an excellent case study in crowdsourcing. Amateurs come together to create the most comprehensive cinematic database of all time. But as Harrison Hoffman of CNET <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13515_3-10000650-26.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-5">pointed out</a> yesterday, the IMDB system also highlights the need for restraints on the crowd's zealous contributions. Seems that this summer's box office smash, <em>Dark Knight</em>, has driven <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> off the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">Top 250</a> List. And in order to maintain its position, Batmanatics have been <em>voting down</em> the Coppala classic. Ewww. Wisdom of the Crowds indeed. My call? Require voters to be registered users and restrict them from voting more than once per week, and then only when sober. </p>

<p>Question of the Day: Are we seeing the emergence of a wiser, less naive brand of crowdsourcing, in which experts and the crowd work together to leverage their respective strengths? </p>

				<p>I have a confession: The last few days I've been experiencing some unusual symptoms: My muscles are loose. My speech has slowed. I'm sleeping deeply and without interruption. My skin has acquired an odd, ruddy cast generally associated with people who don't spend their days under florescent lights. Oddly enough, the last time I felt like this I'd also just returned from a two week vacation. It's possible I'm in a state of blissful relaxation, though I'm too unfamiliar with that feeling to make a positive diagnosis. Besides, like all afflictions (good and bad), it's sure to pass quickly. In fact, I can detect that familiar quickening of the pulse just pondering everything I have to do before the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crowdsourcing-Power-Driving-Future-Business/dp/0307396207">Crowdsourcing book</a> comes out next month. </p>

<p>But enough with the diaristic blather. Kudos to David Cohn for, well, filling my shoes wouldn't be entirely accurate. Let's say instead I hope to fill his. In the meantime, I encountered a few choice bits since returning from my Catskills retreat. </p>

<p>First, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/">Science section</a> published an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/science/22inno.html?pagewanted=all">excellent piece</a> on <a href="http://www.innocentive.com/">InnoCentive</a> and other efforts to apply crowdsourcing to scientific research. Most of the information on InnoCentive will be old hat to readers of this blog, but it also showed the extent to which the strategy is going mainstream:</p><blockquote><p>The approach is catching on. Today, would-be innovators can sign up
online to compete for prizes for feats as diverse as landing on the
Moon (<a href="http://space.xprize.org/lunar-lander-challenge" target="_">space.xprize.org/lunar-lander-challenge</a>) and&nbsp; inventing artificial meat (<a href="http://www.peta.org/feat_in_vitro_contest.asp" target="_">www.peta.org/feat_in_vitro_contest.asp</a>). </p>

<p>This year, researchers at the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/howard_hughes_medical_institute/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Howard Hughes Medical Institute.">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> and the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about University of Washington">University of Washington</a>
began recruiting computer gamers to an online competition, named
Foldit, aimed at unraveling one of the knottiest problems of biology —
how proteins fold (<a href="http://fold.it/" target="_">fold.it</a>). </p></blockquote>
<p>I was especially intrigued by the Foldit project. I've always been careful to highlight the connection between such distributed computing efforts as <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home </a>and crowdsourcing, but Foldit has a direct connection. It evolved out of Rosetta@home, which used the spare cycles on people's PCs to perform the processor-intensive calculations necessary to determine the shapes of proteins. &quot;In Foldit, players will compete online to design proteins, and researchers will test designs to see if they are any good.&quot; The idea isn't to recruit scientists, it's explicitly aims to recruit non-scientists who might have novel ideas of how to construct a protein. As Zoran Popovic, one of the computer scientists at UW running the project notes, &quot;Our ultimate goal is to have ordinary people play the game and eventually be candidates for winning the Nobel Prize.&quot; </p>

<p>In the coming months I'll be using this blog to update and correct my book (which is, alas, out of my reach as it winds its way through the printing process). In the book I note that Congress had debated whether the government should be offering prizes, a la InnoCentive, for creating solutions to thorny problems for the public good, such as creating a cheap Malaria vaccine and creating viable forms of alternative energy. What I hadn't come across is the fact that last year no less an authority than the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.htm">National Research Council </a>recommended that the National Science Foundation—the agency that provides most government funding to scientific research—offer prizes of $200,000 to $2 million in &quot;'diverse areas' as a way of encouraging 'more complex innovations' addressing economic, social and other challenges.&quot; This signifies a major vote of confidence for the use of crowdsourcing in science. The full report can be found <a href="www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11816">here </a>(for&nbsp; $18.90). I wish I'd had it when I was writing the book. </p>

<p>One other passage caught my eye. Dwayne Spradlin, president and CEO of InnoCentive, notes that &quot;more than a third&quot; of InnoCentive solvers have doctorates. My immediate thought on reading this was: <em>only</em> a third?!? I'd always assumed that InnoCentive was one example of crowdsourcing that was resistant to the influx of amateurs that characterizes the phenomenon in general. I thought it an anomaly in this regard, but given that almost all professional science is being conducted by people with PhDs or those working on attaining one, this factoid indicates that maybe InnoCentive is as much an amateur network as, say, <a href="http://istockphoto.com/index.php">iStockPhoto.</a> If anyone at InnoCentive's reading this, could you offer us more insight into the demographics of your solvers? How many of the non-PhDs are coming up with successful solutions? </p>

<p>On the more trivial side, I couldn't help but notice that the article seemed to avoid applying the term crowdsourcing to InnoCentive or the other initiatives in the piece. The reporter uses the term open source science instead. That works for me, though given the extent to which the term has entered the lexicon, it seems like an omission. Especially since the paper included it in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html?pagewanted=print">round up</a> of new words of 2007. But what was striking is that in the same issue the <em>Times</em> did use crowdsourcing in a headline to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/world/lifestyle-electriccar-internet.html?ex=1217390400&amp;en=9494b47613cf1195&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1">a wire piece</a> about a Finnish community, called &quot;eCars—Now!&quot; that is trying to apply a Wiki approach &quot;to start converting used petrol-fuelled 
cars to electric ones.&quot; </p>

<p>Believe it or not, this post was supposed to be a quick collection of links. And I couldn't get past the first link without writing a short essay. David, how do you do it? Find out tomorrow when I attempt a more convincing imitation of my erstwhile guest blogger. <br /></p>

This article warns &quot;development must never lose sight of the users&quot; and in so doing points to the truth, &quot;Knowledge Management Is No Good Without the Knowledge.&quot; Its amazing what a few months will do for a buzz word like crowdsourcing.</p>

<p><em>From Jeff: Sometime yesterday Alan's following post disappeared. Have we been hacked? I can't imagine little ole Crowdsourcing.com drawing such ire from the script kiddies. At any rate, we're reposting it today.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://guambatstew.blogspot.com/2007/04/crowd-control.html">Guambat Stew</a> provides some useful annotation on Marc Wilson's blogpost about online newspapers. &quot;This is about saving Gannett's bacon.&quot; It might be called a freedom of speech issue, discrimination, hypocrisy, being picked on but ultimately it's all about the race to own the Internet and that translates into a rich stew of dollars and cents! </p>

<p>THEORY.ISTHEREASON makes the claim that Singapore will never develop &quot;YouTubes&quot; or &quot;Skypes. His theory looks good but more insightful yet was this interesting comment, &quot;My advice to the government is not to look to citizens to innovate, but to themselves in making a concerted effort understanding what social media (aka Web 2.0) is really about.&quot; This takes the <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=1509">issue</a> to a place where it needs to go.<br /><br />Well what's new? TestTUBE is new but it's old new. Techno//Marketer points out the <a href="http://technomarketer.typepad.com/technomarketer/2007/04/youtube_not_let.html">irony.</a> </p>

<p>If you just awoke from a coma, been stranded on a desert island, or just plain old out of it, <a href="http://newmusicstrategies.com/2007/04/02/thing-6-web-20/">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://newmusicstrategies.com/2007/04/02/thing-6-web-20/">New Music Strategies</a> has a great overview to get you up to speed.</p>

<p>I want to go back to Africa! Yes, it looks like the place to be in April. Wikipedia Founder, Jimmy Wales and Creative Commons CEO, Larry Lessig will be in South Africa for a host of festivities to celebrate digital freedom in the country. Check out the program <a href="http://icommons.org/events/">here</a> .<br /><br />Mark Glaser of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/">MEDIASHIFT</a> has a great article on The Working Journalist in the Age of the Internet. He even mentions Chris Allbritton of <a href="http://www.back-to-iraq.com/">Back to Iraq </a>in regard to the very early days of crowd-sponsored blogging.</p>

				<p>Jay Rosen <a href="http://pjnet.org/weblogs/pjnettoday/archives/001511.html">interviewed</a> by Leonard Witt who teases with the tidbit, I've signed up with AZ and might be doing an assignment!</p>

<p>Bad news good news! On one hand, two million women have been treated for breast cancer in the US. No wonder the reaction to John and Elizabeth Edwards' decision to stay in the presidential race was so immediate. The NYT broke tradition to use &quot;crowdsource&quot; reporting from its own blog for the very first time. The numbers are amazing, the comments heartfelt! <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-melber/crowdsourcing-elizabeth-e_b_44275.html">The Huffington Post</a> covers the details.</p>

<p>Steve Poland (contributing writer to TechCrunch) has just launched a new site called <a href="http://www.ringsidestartup.com/">Ringside Startup</a>.&nbsp; A web start-up crowdsourced, down for the count in my corner! </p>

<p>Andrew McAfee spars with Tom Davenport! &quot;My optimism, and my interest in the component technologies of Enterprise 2.0, comes not (solely) from my inherent geekiness, but from the fact that these technologies really are something new under the sun .... They're not extensions or enhancements to previous generations of corporate tools for collaboration and knowledge management; instead, they're radical departures from them .... What they will do, I believe, is give managers who want more lateralism, egalitarianism, crowdsourcing, idea percolation, self-organization, collective intelligence, etc. a new and unprecedented opportunity to obtain them.&quot; Join the bout <a href="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/i_still_agree_with_tom_and_yet/">here</a>! <br /><br />Must Read: Bob Garfield's <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=115712">Chaos Scenario 2.0</a>—The Post Advertising Age&nbsp; <br /><br />And read on some more!
