The paper excels in the detailed review of the algorithm construction and the experimental validation of the models.</p><p>3. The only weakness is the limitation of four image categories and the absence of a formal hypothesis and variable control methodology to avoid the HARK potential (hypothesizing after results are known).</p><p>4. An exciting concept for me was the previously unrealized potential to combine automated search with human search on the basis of automated results and the implication that crowdsourcing offers the fast response of parallel processing with the low cost of serial processing.</p><p>5. I had some difficulty understanding the probability density functions used to build the delay models.</p><p>6. The authors argue that the predictive and decision-making (automate versus human) algorithms offer potential beyond image search, and while I agree that the concepts can be extended to audio, I would like to explore the application of this approach to non-multimedia non-search sequential computations, particularly one which could dynamically alter human task assignment based on first responses.</p>

    <p>Adriana K.</p><p>1. This paper presents a method for improving image search results (when the query is also an image) by obtaining validation from humans of the images that are automatically returned from a search, where validation tasks are resubmitted based on the conclusions that can be drawn from the validation results already obtained and a prediction of the delay and content of future responses.</p><p>2. The greatest strength of this paper is that it offers a technique for predicting the delay of the humans’ responses based on training data and currently received responses, as well as predicting  the actual result (yes/no) of these responses, and thus enables an active approach to crowdsourcing (as opposed to simply submitting requests and waiting for responses).</p><p>3. The greatest weakness of this paper, in my humble opinion, is that despite the good results, it is not perfectly clear how good the algorithm for predicting delay is—it seems to me that one cannot very reliably predict future responses based on just the first returned response, and I am not sure what sort of training data one has to obtain since every image is different, and the only images that can help in training are images of similar difficulty, which is not really measured.</p><p>4. I learned that it is better to separate validation tasks into single pairs of query and candidate image, rather than presenting the humans with multiple such pairs, since smaller tasks get completed faster and more accurately.</p><p>5. I did not understand what sort of training data is used for predicting the results of validation and whether this data is specific to the query image or its class.</p><p>6. I would like to learn more about whether it is really true that the probability of some given delay and of some validation content are independent, and if not, in what sort of cases where they might be dependent.</p>

    <p>1.	This paper introduces a mobile phone application in which users can search for images in real time by combining automated image search with human validation.</p><p>2.	A main strength of the paper is that it provides detailed diagrams of how the search works in addition to the actual algorithm that drives the application.</p><p>3.	The paper does not do a great job of explaining the motive that would cause someone to use this application: why would an individual take a picture of a building that was in front of him to find out what it is instead of just finding the name of the building?</p><p>4.	I learned that a serial scheme is one that optimizes solely the monetary cost.</p><p>5.	I did not understand the user population that would use this service.</p><p>6.	I would like to learn more about systems that employ multiple types of crowdsourcing (e.g. real time + tag pictures).</p>

    <p>1.	Summary of paper: This paper describes a crowdsourcing solution for image searching on mobile phones, offering “human validation” for a problem that plagues information retrieval.</p><p>2.	Greatest strength: The greatest strength of this paper lies in the modeling; I was particular impressed with the innovative model for delay-accuracy-cost behavior of crowdsourced users.</p><p>3.	Greatest weakness: I felt like the “Related Work” section of the paper was unnecessary and added little to the value of the paper.</p><p>4.	Something I learned: The methodology used to test this system was thorough and fascinating, and the authors did an excellent job of explaining the thought process behind their experimental design.</p><p>5.	Something I didn’t understand: Even though I thought the models were interesting, I have to admit that I didn’t quite follow the entire math portion.</p><p>6.	Something I’d like to know more about: I’m far from an particular expert on information retrieval, so I’d like to examine more on this topic area as it relates to crowdsourcing.</p><p>-janoble</p>

    <p>[Katya_Lyka]</p><p>1.The paper talks about a new mobile based image search system which uses crowdsourcing platform to validate image results. The paper proposes an algorithm and functions with the help of which it uses human validation to provide the user with the most accurate image search result.</p><p>2.The paper takes into account the delay involved in human validation tasks such as acceptance delay and submission delay. The crowdsearch system very cleverly balances between parallel and serial posting</p><p>3.The image search engine is only trained on a thousand images which is very less considering the kind of accuracy the system predicts also it limits the images to 4 categories only</p><p>4.The algorithm is very interesting and takes into account a lot of factors - user delay, accuracy and cost</p><p>5.I did not understand exactly how they evaluate their system also the delay predict function was a little difficult to understand</p><p>6.I would like to know the feasibility and usage of these kinds of systems. Would people be ready to pay for such kind of applications? What will motivate the people?</p>
